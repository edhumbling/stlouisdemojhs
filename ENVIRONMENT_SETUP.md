# Environment Setup Guide

## ðŸ”§ Required Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in your project root with the following variables:

```bash
# Groq API Configuration (for both AI and Speech-to-Text)
VITE_GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

1. **Copy the environment variables above into a `.env` file**
2. **Run the application**: `npm run dev`
3. **Test the AI**: Visit `/louis-ai` and start chatting!

## ðŸ”’ Security Notes

- The `.env` file should be added to `.gitignore`
- Never commit API keys to version control
- For production, consider using a backend proxy to hide tokens
