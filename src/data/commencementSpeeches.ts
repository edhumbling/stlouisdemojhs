    fullText: `Good morning!

I am so happy to be here with you all. I'm proud to be here in the Big Easy. Look at you all! You look good.

Thank you. I want to start by thanking Nicole for that very kind introduction and for sharing her story, which is not too unfamiliar to me -- because they told me I couldn't be where I am, too. So I want to thank Nicole. I'm proud of her. Thank you for the selfie; I think that's the first selfie I've done at a commencement. So, Nicole, you're my first.

And of course, I want to thank the Dillard University Choir. Oh, oh, oh! Oh! That's all I can say. It's like you want to start something up in here, right? It's like, now we got a commencement going on up in here. That was beautiful, beautiful. Thank you so much.

I also want to recognize Senator Mary Landrieu, who is here. Let's give her a hand. She has been a strong supporter of this university.

I want to thank the Dillard University Board of Trustees. I want to thank the faculty, the staff, and, of course, your tremendous president, Dr. Walter Kimbrough. Now, my husband has been called a few things over the years, but he has never had the honor of being referred to as the "Hip Hop President."

I also want to thank all the folks from the University of New Orleans for hosting us here today. And I know they're hosting the folks at Southern University at New Orleans for their commencement later on today as well, so we wish them a wonderful day. And thank you for having us.

And of course, I've got to give a big shout-out to all the family members in the crowd, all of the family members -- especially to the mothers, because it is the day before Mother's Day. To all the mothers, Happy Mother's Day.

Now, graduates, you all handled your business, right? Just because you were graduating didn't mean you -- come on, now. Okay, well, if you didn't, you have my permission to get up and go right now, because there is nothing more important -- no, no, don't get up. Your mothers would kill you if you got up at this moment. So just stay in your seats, and when this is all over make sure you take care of mom.

But in all seriousness, to all the moms out there -- as well as the dads and the grandparents, the uncles, the aunts, the brothers, the sisters, all of you who have helped raise these graduates -- you have seen them through their ups and downs, and you have poured your hearts and souls into these men and women. So today is your day, too, and you should be very proud. You really should.

And finally, most of all, I want to congratulate the beautiful and handsome men and women of the Dillard University Class of 2014. Yay! You all have come so far, I know, to make it to this day -- from all those early days when the girls were sneaking out of Williams Hall to go see the boys over at the Duals -- oh yeah, I did my research -- to all those tests you crammed for, to the plans you're making now for your careers, to go on to graduate school.

You all have seen so much. You've witnessed this school's rebirth after the devastation of Hurricane Katrina -- the new buildings that replaced the ones you lost, the classrooms that started filling back up again, the service projects that you all have done to help this community bounce back. And I know along the way that each of you has written your own story of resilience and determination to make it here to this day.

For example, as you heard, Nicole was told back in high school that she just wasn't college material. But now she is your class president, and she's headed off to Yale for her graduate degree. So there. That's it.

And I know that some of you may come from tough neighborhoods; some of you may have lost your homes during Katrina. Maybe you're like DeShawn Dabney, a graduate who was raised by his grandmother -- maybe -- that's your grandmother, isn't it, DeShawn? Raised by his grandmother while some of his family members were dealing with issues. Maybe just like him, you've been working part-time jobs since you were a teenager to make your dream of going to college come true. And now, today, you're all here ready to walk across this stage and get that diploma.

And no matter what path you took to get here, you all kept your hearts set on this day. You fought through every challenge you encountered, and you earned that degree from this fine university. And in doing so, you are following in the footsteps of all those who came before you, and you have become an indelible part of the history of this school -- a history that, as you all know, stretches back to well before the Civil War, back to 1826, the year a child named Emperor Williams was born.

Now, Emperor was born into slavery. But as he grew up, he managed to teach himself to read and write well enough to create a pass that allowed him to come and go around the city without getting hassled. But one day, his master saw the pass and he said, where did you learn to write like that? Now, just imagine the fear Emperor must have felt when he heard that question -- because remember, back then it was illegal for a slave to learn to read or write. So who knows what kind of punishment he may have gotten -- a beating, a whipping, even worse.

We don't exactly know what happened on that day, but we do know that when Emperor turned 32, after more than three decades in bondage, he became a free man. He decided to stay in New Orleans, and he went on to become a minister -- even founded a church right here in town. And in 1869, when abolitionists, missionaries, black folks and white folks came together to create a school for freed slaves here in New Orleans, Emperor was one of the original signers of the charter.

They decided to name the school New Orleans University, because even though most of the classes would be taught at a high school level or below, oh, their aspirations were much higher than that. And when they laid the cornerstone for that university's first building down on St. Charles Avenue, Emperor got a chance to speak.

He said -- and these are his words -- he said, "For twenty years I was a slave on these streets. It was a penitentiary offense to educate a Negro. I have seen my fellow-servants whipped for trying to learn; but today here am I, speaking where a building is to be erected for the education of the children of my people." He goes on to say, "I wonder if this is the world I was born in."

See, in the course of his short lifetime, Emperor saw education go from being a crime for black folks to being a real possibility for his kids and grandkids. So no wonder he was asking whether this was the same world he'd been born into. See, for a man like Emperor, getting an education could open up a whole new world of opportunity. An education meant having real power. It meant you could manage your own money. It meant you couldn't get swindled out of land or possessions when somebody told you to just sign on the dotted line; sometimes even determined whether or not you could vote.

So most folks back then saw education as the key to real and lasting freedom. That's why, when New Orleans University and the other African American college in town, Straight University, first opened their doors, one of the biggest problems they faced was too many students. That's right -- too many students. Many of these students barely spoke English; they'd grown up speaking Creole or French. Few had ever seen the inside of a classroom or even been taught their ABCs.

But let me tell you, those students were hungry -- you hear me? Hungry. They studied like their lives depended on it. They blazed through their lessons. And that hunger for education lasted for generations in the African American community here in New Orleans.

When an arsonist set fire to the school's library in 1877, they built a new one. When those two original schools ran into financial troubles years later, they started making plans to build an even bigger and better university. And in the 1930s, when white folks complained that this new school would mean too many black students on their buses, the folks at the school got the city to add a bus line just for their students, because nothing -- nothing -- was going to stop them from achieving the vision of those early founders.

And finally, in May of 1934, they broke ground for this school, Dillard University -- a university that would go on to produce some of the leading thinkers and achievers in our country. And the day the cornerstone was laid for your library, the President of Howard University spoke these words: He said, "There lies in this Southland today, buried in unmarked graves, many a black genius who would have blessed this city and this section of our country, if only his parents could have had before them the Dillard University you are now building."

And in the years since then, through segregation and depression, through threats of violence and the floodwaters of a devastating storm, students like you have come here to study and to learn, and to carry forward those hopes and dreams. And today, I stand before a sea of young geniuses. Oh, yeah.

So, graduates, I hope that you understand that this day is not just the culmination of your own dreams, but the realization of the dreams of so many who came before you. And you should be so proud, and so happy, and so excited about your futures. But what you shouldn't be is satisfied. See, because while it is a wonderful thing that all of you are here today, we have to ask ourselves, what about all those geniuses who never get this chance?

I'm talking about the young people from right here in New Orleans and across the country who aren't part of a commencement like this one today, kids no different from all of us, kids who never made it out of high school. The fact is that today, the high school graduation rate for black students is improving, but it is still lower than just about any other group in this country. And while college graduation rates have risen for nearly every other demographic, including African American women, the college graduation rate for African American men has flatlined.

See, and the thing is, when our young people fall behind like that in school, they fall behind in life. Last year, African Americans were more than twice as likely as whites to be unemployed. They were almost three times as likely to live in poverty. And they were far more likely to end up in prison or be the victims of violent crimes.

Now, perhaps when you hear these statistics, you might think to yourself, well, those numbers are terrible, but I'm not part of the problem. And you might be thinking that since you're not one of those statistics, and you're sitting here wearing that nice black robe today, you can go on your way and never look back.

But folks like you and me, we can't afford to think like that -- never. See, because we're the lucky ones, and we can never forget that we didn't get where we are today all on our own. We got here today because of so many people who toiled and sweat and bled and died for us -- people like our parents and grandparents and all those who came before them, people who never dreamed of getting a college education themselves but who worked, and saved, and sacrificed so that we could be here today. We owe them. We owe them.

And the only way to pay back that debt is by making those same kinds of sacrifices and investments for the next generation. And I know sitting here right now, that task could seem a bit overwhelming. I know it could seem like the deck is stacked way too high against our young people. And the truth is that some of the problems we face -- structural inequality, schools that lag behind, workplace and housing discrimination -- those problems are too big for one person to fix on their own.

But that's still no excuse to stand on the sidelines. Because we know that today, education is still the key to real and lasting freedom -- it is still true today. So it is now up to us to cultivate that hunger for education in our own lives and in those around us. And we know that hunger is still out there -- we know it.

We see it in students like DeShawn and Nicole and all of you who scraped and clawed so you could make it to this day. We see it in the single moms who work three jobs so their kids might have a shot at earning a degree like yours. We see that hunger all around the world -- in that young woman named Malala who was shot on her school bus in Pakistan just for speaking out in support of girls getting an education, and the more than 200 girls kidnapped from their own school in Nigeria for wanting an education -- young people who are knowingly risking their lives every day just to go to school.

And in fact, you've seen that hunger right here at Dillard: your valedictorian, three salutatorians are all from Nigeria. They studied hard at an early age, earned scholarships to come here to this university, achieved 4.0 GPAs. And now they are off pursuing master's degrees, work in software development, teaching math and science to young people here in the United States.

See, now, that's the kind of hunger for education that we have to reignite in all of our communities. It's the same hunger that gave life to this university, the same hunger that defined so many of our parents and grandparents -- including my own. You see, my parents never went to college, but they were determined to see me and my brother and all the kids in our neighborhood get a good education.

So my mother volunteered at my school -- helping out every day in the front office, making sure our teachers were doing their jobs, holding their feet to the fire if she thought they were falling short. I'd walk by the office and there she'd be. I'd leave class to go to the bathroom, there she'd be again, roaming the halls, looking in the classrooms. And of course, as a kid, I have to say, that was a bit mortifying, having your mother at school all the time.

But looking back, I have no doubt that my classmates and I got a better education because she was looking over those teachers' shoulders. You see, my mom was not a teacher or a principal or a school board member. But when it came to education, she had that hunger. So she believed that our education was very much her business.

And we need more people who think and act like my mother, and all those mothers out there, because the education of our young people is all of our business. That's what Emperor Williams thought. That's what the folks here in New Orleans thought as they worked to rebuild this campus after Katrina. And as graduates of Dillard University, that's how we need you to think every single day for the rest of your lives.

You all have opportunities and skills and education that so many folks who came before you never could have dreamed of. So just imagine the kind of impact that you're going to make. Imagine how you can inspire those around you to reach higher and complete their own education.

And you can start small. Start by volunteering at an after-school program, or helping some high school kids fill out their college applications. Show them the path that you took. Or you can think a little bigger -- you can get your entire congregation or your community to start a mentoring program; maybe convince your new employer to sponsor scholarships for underprivileged kids. Or maybe you could think a little higher -- maybe you could run for school board or Congress, or, yes, even President of the United States.

And then maybe you could build preschools for every single one of our kids. Maybe you could help turn that pipeline to prison into a highway to college; help give every child in America an education that is truly worth of their promise. Those are the kind of big dreams that folks who founded this university reached for. That is how high they set their bar.

And so we owe it to those folks -- the folks who had the audacity to call their little schools "universities" and name their baby boys "Emperor" -- we owe it to them to reach as high as they did, and to bring others along the way. As the history of this school has taught us, no dream is too big, no vision is too bold; as long as we stay hungry for education and let that hunger be our North Star, there is nothing, graduates, nothing that we cannot achieve.

So, graduates, that is your mission. This is your obligation. I want you to keep reaching higher. I want you all to keep raising your bars. Let the next generation know that there is no greater investment than a good education. And if you do all of this, then I am confident that you will uphold that duty and write your own chapter into the legacy of this great university. And let me tell you something, I cannot wait to see the world that your children will be born into.

Congratulations. I love you all. I am honored to be here. I am proud of you. God bless you. And thank your families.`

    fullText: `Alright, thank you.

So, I've got about apparently I've got about five to six minutes to say the most useful things I can think of.

I'm gonna do my best.

It was suggested that I distill things down to 3 items.

I think I'll go with four.

And I'll try, I think, I think these are pretty important ones.

Some of it may kinda sound like, well you've heard them before.

But, you know, worth reemphasizing.

I think the first is, you need to work, if you, depending on how well you want to do, particularly if you want to start a company, you need to work super hard.

So what is super hard mean?

Well, when my brother and I were starting our first company, instead of getting an apartment, we just rented a small office and we slept on the couch and we showered in the YMCA.

We're so hard up that we had just one computer.

So the website was up during the day, and I was coding at night.

7 days a week, all the time.

And I, sort of briefly had a girlfriend in that period and in order to be with me, she had to sleep in the office.

So, work hard, like, every waking hour.

That's the thing I would say, particularly if you're starting a company.

And I mean, if you do the simple math, you say like somebody else is working 50 hours a week and you're working 100, you'll get twice as done, as much done, in the course of the year as the other company.

The other thing I'd say is that if you're creating a company, or if you're joining a company, the most important thing is to attract great people.

So either be with, join a group that's amazing, that you really respect.

Or, if you're building a company, you've got to gather great people.

I mean, all a company is is a group of people that have gathered together to create a product or service.

So depending upon how talented and hard working that group is, and to the degree in which they are focused cohesively in a good direction, that will determine the success of the company.

So, do everything you can to gather great people, if you're creating a company.

Then, I'd say focus on signal over noise.

A lot of companies get confused.

They spend a lot of money on things that don't actually make the product better.

So, for example, at Tesla, we've never spent any money on advertising.

We've put all the money into R and D and manufacturing and design to try and make the car as good as possible.

And, I think that's the way to go. For any given company, keep thinking about, "Are, these efforts that people are expending, are they resulting in a better product or service?"

And if they're not, stop those efforts.

And then the final thing is, is to sort of, don't just follow the trend.

So, you may have heard me say that it's good to thinking terms of the physics approach, the first principles.

With is, rather than reasoning by analogy, you boil things down to the most fundamental truths you can imagine, and then you reason up from there.

And this is a good way to figure out if something really makes sense, or is it just what everybody else is doing.

It's hard to think that way, you can't think that way about everything.

It takes a lot of effort. But if you're trying to do something new, it's the best way to thing.

And that framework was developed by physicists to figure out counter intuitive things, like quantum mechanics.

It's really a powerful, powerful method.

And anyways, so that's, and then the final thing I would encourage you to do is now is the time to take risks.

You don't have kids, you're obligations, well! Some of you… Hahaha, you probably don't have kids.

But as you get older, your obligations start to increase.

So, and, once you have a family, you start taking risks not just for yourself, but for your family as well.

It gets harder to do things that might not work out. So now is the time to do that.

Before you have those obligations. So I would encourage you to take risks now, and to do something bold.

You won't regret it. Thank you.

I don't know if it was helpful. Great.`

I am honored to be here. I am honored to be here with all of you. I am honored to be here with the class of 2015.

I want to start by telling you something that I wish somebody had told me when I was sitting where you are today. And it is this: You don't have to be grateful for everything.

I know this sounds strange, coming from somebody who has been as fortunate as I have been. But I think gratitude is important, and I think it's important to be grateful for the good things in your life. But I also think it's important to be angry about the bad things. And I think it's important to be angry about injustice.

All over the world, girls are raised to make themselves likeable, to twist themselves into shapes that suit other people. Please do not twist yourself into shapes to please. Don't do it. If someone likes that version of you, that version of you that is false and holds back, then they actually just like that twisted shape, and not you. And the world is such a gloriously multifaceted, diverse place that there are people in the world who will like you, the real you, as you are.

I want to talk to you about being a young woman in the world. And the first thing I want to say is this: Be a full person. A full person is a complicated thing. You can be intelligent and a good cook. You can be a good cook and be not-so-good at math. You can love fashion and love physics. You can be a whole person.

I think we do a great disservice to boys in how we raise them. We stifle the humanity of boys. We define masculinity in a very narrow way. Masculinity is a hard, small cage, and we put boys inside this cage.

We teach boys to be afraid of fear, of weakness, of vulnerability. We teach them to mask their true selves, because they have to be, in Nigerian-speak, a hard man.

But by doing this, we rob them of a full range of human emotions. We rob them of the ability to be vulnerable, which is the birthplace of innovation, of creativity, of change.

The problem with gender is that it prescribes how we should be rather than recognizing how we are. Imagine how much happier we would be, how much freer to be our true individual selves, if we didn't have the weight of gender expectations.

I want to talk about work. I want you to reject the idea of work-life balance. The phrase 'work-life balance' is not only impossible to achieve; it's also a trap. It assumes that work is separate from life, when in fact, work is part of life.

Instead, I want you to think about work-life integration. How can you integrate your work into your life in a way that makes sense for you? How can you make your work meaningful? How can you make your life meaningful?

And please, when you get that first job, and you will, don't spend your time trying to make your boss happy. Spend your time trying to do good work. Good work speaks for itself.

I want to talk about love. Love is not something that you find. Love is something that you create. Love is something that you build. Love is something that you work at every single day.

And when you love, love fully. Love with your whole heart. Love without reservation. But also love with your eyes wide open. Love does not mean that you have to lose yourself.

I want to talk about failure. You will fail. I have failed many times. Failure is not the opposite of success; it's part of success. When you fail, and you will, don't let it define you. Let it teach you.

I want to talk about feminism. I am a feminist. And I think you should be feminists too. Feminism is not about hating men. It's about justice. It's about fairness. It's about giving women the same opportunities that men have.

Some people ask me, 'Why do you call yourself a feminist? Why not just say you believe in human rights?' The reason is that for centuries, women have been excluded from the idea of what it means to be human. Feminism is about including women in the idea of what it means to be human.

I want to end by saying this: You are graduating from one of the finest institutions in the world. You have been given an incredible gift. But with that gift comes responsibility. You have a responsibility to use your education, your privilege, your voice to make the world a better place.

The world needs you. The world needs your ideas, your energy, your passion. The world needs you to be brave, to be bold, to be unapologetically yourselves.

So go out there and create the world you want to live in. Go out there and be the change you want to see. Go out there and be magnificent.

Thank you.`

It's an honor to be here with you today. And I have to say, I'm a little nervous. The last time I spoke at a university commencement, the students gave me a standing ovation. Of course, that was because I told them I was cutting my remarks short.

But seriously, I'm thrilled to be here at one of America's great public universities. UNC has been a beacon of excellence for more than two centuries, and you graduates are carrying on that tradition.

Now, I know that some of you may be wondering: What's a guy from New York doing here in Chapel Hill? Well, the truth is, I've always had a soft spot for North Carolina. After all, this is the state that gave us Michael Jordan, and as a lifelong basketball fan, I have to respect that.

But I'm really here because I believe in what this university represents: the power of public education to transform lives and communities. And I believe in what you represent: the next generation of leaders who will shape our world.

Now, I want to share with you some lessons I've learned over the years. And the first one is this: Follow your heart, and go with your gut.

When I was your age, I thought I had my life all figured out. I was going to be an engineer, work for a big company, climb the corporate ladder. But life had other plans.

After business school, I took a job on Wall Street. I loved the energy, the competition, the fast pace. But then, in 1981, I got fired. At the time, it felt like the end of the world. But it turned out to be the beginning of something much better.

I used my severance package to start Bloomberg LP. People thought I was crazy. Here I was, competing against established giants like Reuters and Dow Jones. But I believed we could do it better.

And you know what? We did. Today, Bloomberg is a global company with more than 15,000 employees in 192 locations around the world.

The lesson here is simple: Don't be afraid to take risks. Don't be afraid to fail. Some of the best opportunities come disguised as disasters.

The second lesson I want to share is this: Out-hustle the competition.

There's no substitute for hard work. Show up early, stay late, and always be prepared. When I was starting Bloomberg, I worked seven days a week. I slept in the office. I did whatever it took.

Now, I'm not saying you should sacrifice your health or your relationships. But I am saying that if you want to succeed, you have to be willing to work harder than the next person.

And don't be afraid to throw some elbows when necessary. Business is competitive. Politics is competitive. Life is competitive. If you're not willing to fight for what you believe in, someone else will take it from you.

The third lesson is about teamwork. No one succeeds alone. Surround yourself with people who are smarter than you, who challenge you, who make you better.

At Bloomberg, we've always believed that diversity makes us stronger. We hire the best people, regardless of their background, their gender, their race, their religion. And that diversity of thought and experience has been one of our greatest competitive advantages.

The fourth lesson is about giving back. Success isn't just about what you achieve for yourself. It's about what you do for others.

I've been fortunate in my life. I've been able to build a successful business, serve as mayor of New York City, and now focus on philanthropy. But none of that would have been possible without the opportunities that others gave me.

That's why I believe so strongly in public education, in public health, in public service. These are the institutions that give everyone a chance to succeed, regardless of where they come from.

And that brings me to my final lesson: Don't make decisions based on money alone.

I know that many of you are graduating with student loans. I know that you're worried about finding a job, paying your bills, starting your careers. Those are legitimate concerns.

But don't let money be the only factor in your decisions. Do what you love. Find a way to get paid for it. And if you ever have the luxury of multiple job offers, don't make the decision based on salary alone.

Choose the job that will teach you the most, that will challenge you the most, that will give you the best foundation for the rest of your career.

Money will come and go. But the skills you learn, the relationships you build, the impact you make – those things will last forever.

So as you leave here today, remember these lessons: Follow your heart. Work hard. Build great teams. Give back. And don't let money be your only guide.

The world needs your energy, your ideas, your passion. The world needs you to solve problems, to create opportunities, to make a difference.

You have the education, the tools, and the talent to do amazing things. Now go out there and do them.

Congratulations, Class of 2012. The future is yours.

Thank you.`

Wow, what an honor to be here today. Thank you, President Nikias. Thank you, Board of Trustees. Faculty, families, and most importantly, graduates of USC Class of 2011!

I have to tell you, I am pumped to be here! This is fantastic! USC! Fight on!

You know, when I was asked to speak here today, I was thrilled. USC has always held a special place in my heart. This is a university that understands passion, that understands excellence, that understands what it means to fight on!

And that's what I want to talk to you about today: passion, ideas, and tenacity. These three things – boom! – bake them in, and they'll really take you a long way.

Let me start with ideas. Great ideas matter. They can change everything. They can change your life, they can change the world.

When I was at Harvard Business School, I had a professor who said something that stuck with me. He said, "The power of an idea is not in its complexity, but in its ability to change how people think and act."

That's what happened with Microsoft. Bill Gates and Paul Allen had an idea: a computer on every desk and in every home. People thought they were crazy. Computers were these massive machines that filled entire rooms. But they had a vision, and they pursued it with passion.

And look what happened. Today, there are billions of computers around the world. That idea changed everything.

But here's the thing about ideas: they're not enough by themselves. You need passion to bring them to life.

Passion is your job to discover. It's not something that just happens to you. You have to go out and find it. You have to try things, experiment, take risks.

I found my passion in technology, in software, in the incredible potential of what we could build. But your passion might be completely different. It might be in medicine, in education, in art, in business, in public service.

The key is to keep looking until you find it. And when you do find it, embrace it with everything you've got.

Because here's what I've learned: when you're passionate about something, work doesn't feel like work. Challenges become opportunities. Obstacles become puzzles to solve.

At Microsoft, we used to have this saying: "We're not just building software, we're changing the world." That passion, that sense of purpose, that's what drove us to work those crazy hours, to push through the difficult times, to never give up.

Which brings me to the third thing: tenacity. Be tenacious. Be irrepressible.

You're going to face setbacks. You're going to face failures. You're going to face people who tell you that your ideas won't work, that you're not good enough, that you should give up.

Don't listen to them. Be tenacious.

When I joined Microsoft in 1980, we were a small company with big dreams. We faced competition from much larger companies. We made mistakes. We had products that failed.

But we never gave up. We kept pushing, kept innovating, kept believing in our vision.

And you know what? That tenacity paid off. Microsoft became one of the most successful companies in the world, and we helped usher in the personal computer revolution.

But tenacity isn't just about business success. It's about life success. It's about not giving up on your dreams, your relationships, your values.

It's about getting back up every time you get knocked down. It's about learning from your failures and using them to become stronger.

Now, I want to talk specifically about USC and why I think this university is so special.

USC has a culture that promotes passion and tenacity. This is a place where people dream big and work hard to achieve those dreams.

Look around you. Look at your classmates. These are people who didn't just coast through college. These are people who got involved, who took risks, who pushed themselves to be better.

That's the USC spirit. That's what "Fight On" really means. It means never giving up. It means always striving for excellence. It means having the courage to pursue your dreams, no matter how big they are.

And that spirit, that culture, that's something you'll carry with you for the rest of your lives.

So as you leave here today, remember these three things: Ideas matter. Find your passion. Be tenacious.

The world needs your ideas. The world needs your passion. The world needs your tenacity.

You're graduating at an incredible time. Technology is advancing at an unprecedented pace. Global challenges require innovative solutions. There are opportunities everywhere for people who are willing to think big and work hard.

Don't be afraid to take risks. Don't be afraid to fail. Don't be afraid to dream big.

You have the education, the skills, and the USC spirit to do amazing things. Now go out there and do them!

Fight on, Class of 2011! Fight on!

Thank you!`

Dean Khurana, faculty, proud parents, and graduates, thank you so much for letting me share this amazing day with you.

As I look out at all of you, I'm reminded of my own graduation day and how excited I was to get started with my life. I'm sure you feel the same way.

Today I want to talk to you about gifts and choices. Cleverness is a gift, kindness is a choice. Gifts are easy -- they're given after all. Choices can be hard.

You can seduce yourself with your gifts if you're not careful, and if you do, it'll probably be to the detriment of your choices.

This is a group with many gifts. I'm sure one of your gifts is the gift of a sharp and creative mind. I'm also sure you have other gifts, and I'm sure you've worked hard to develop them.

When I was 12 years old, I was a garage inventor. I invented an automatic gate closer out of cement-filled tires, a solar cooker that didn't work very well, and a device to entrap my siblings.

Yesterday, as I was preparing this speech, I called my mom to ask her what she remembered about that time. She said what she remembered was that I was always making a mess and never cleaning it up. Fair point.

You know what she didn't say? She didn't say, "Well, you were gifted." She said I was always making a mess. That's not about gifts, that's about choices.

I will hazard a prediction. When you are 80 years old, and in a quiet moment of reflection narrating for only yourself the most personal version of your life story, the telling that will be most compact and meaningful will be the series of choices you have made. In the end, we are our choices.

Build yourself a great story.

Thank you, and congratulations to the class of 2010.

I want to talk about choice. You can choose to be lazy or you can choose to work hard. You can choose to follow your passions or you can choose to follow the safe path.

When I graduated from Princeton in 1986, I had offers from Wall Street firms, and I had this crazy idea about starting something called an online bookstore.

Most people, including my parents, thought I was making a mistake. They said, "You have a good job on Wall Street. Why would you give that up for something that probably won't work?"

But I had what I called a "regret minimization framework." I projected myself forward to age 80 and asked: Will I regret not trying this thing that I'm passionate about?

The answer was clear. I knew I would regret not trying more than I would regret failing.

So I left my job, drove across the country with my wife, and started Amazon in a garage in Bellevue, Washington.

It wasn't easy. For the first few years, I was packing books on my hands and knees on a concrete floor. We couldn't afford desks, so we made them out of doors from Home Depot.

But I was following my passion, and that made all the difference.

Today, Amazon is one of the largest companies in the world. But more importantly, we've been able to create hundreds of thousands of jobs and serve millions of customers.

None of that would have happened if I had chosen the safe path.

So my advice to you is this: Follow your passion. Take risks. Don't be afraid to fail.

But also remember that with great gifts come great responsibilities. You have been given so much. You have brilliant minds, you have access to incredible resources, you have opportunities that most people in the world can only dream of.

What are you going to do with those gifts?

Are you going to use them just for yourself? Or are you going to use them to make the world a better place?

I hope you choose the latter.

The world needs your energy, your passion, your creativity. The world needs you to solve big problems, to create new opportunities, to build a better future.

So as you leave here today, remember: Cleverness is a gift, kindness is a choice. Gifts are easy, choices can be hard.

Choose to be kind. Choose to work hard. Choose to follow your passion. Choose to make a difference.

In the end, we are our choices. Build yourself a great story.

Congratulations, Class of 2010. Thank you.`

    fullText: `Thank you, President Hennessy, and to the trustees and the faculty, to all of the parents and grandparents, to you, the Stanford graduates. Thank you for letting me share this amazing day with you.

I need to begin by letting everyone in on a little secret. The secret is that Kirby Bumpus, Stanford Class of '08, is my goddaughter. So, I was thrilled when President Hennessy asked me to be your Commencement speaker, because this is the first time I've been allowed on campus since Kirby's been here.

You see, Kirby's a very smart girl. She wants people to get to know her on her own terms, she says. Not in terms of who she knows. So, she never wants anyone who's first meeting her to know that I know her and she knows me.

But I also know why my dad was insisting on that diploma, because, as B. B. King put it, "The beautiful thing about learning is that nobody can take that away from you." And learning is really in the broadest sense what I want to talk about today, because your education, of course, isn't ending here. In many ways, it's only just begun.

The world has so many lessons to teach you. I consider the world, this Earth, to be like a school and our life the classrooms. And sometimes here in this Planet Earth school the lessons often come dressed up as detours or roadblocks. And sometimes as full-blown crises. And the secret I've learned to getting ahead is being open to the lessons, lessons from the grandest university of all, that is, the universe itself.

It's being able to walk through life eager and open to self-improvement and that which is going to best help you evolve, 'cause that's really why we're here, to evolve as human beings. To grow into more of ourselves, always moving to the next level of understanding, the next level of compassion and growth.

So, today, I just want to share a few lessons—meaning three—that I've learned in my journey so far. The three lessons that have had the greatest impact on my life have to do with feelings, with failure and with finding happiness.

A year after I left college, I was given the opportunity to co-anchor the 6 o'clock news in Baltimore. So, I was 22 years old, making $22,000 a year. And it's where I met my best friend, Gayle, who was an intern at the same TV station.

So, here I am, 22, making $22,000 a year and, yet, it didn't feel right. The first sign was when they tried to change my name. The news director said to me at the time, "Nobody's going to remember Oprah. So, we want to change your name. We've come up with a name we think that people will remember and people will like. It's a friendly name: Suzie."

But my name wasn't Suzie. So, I thought, no, it doesn't feel right. I'm not going to change my name. And if people remember it or not, that's OK.

And then they said they didn't like the way I looked. So, they sent me to a salon where they gave me a perm, and after a few days all my hair fell out and I had to shave my head. And then they really didn't like the way I looked.

But even worse than being bald, I really hated, hated, hated being sent to report on other people's tragedies as a part of my daily duty, knowing that I was just expected to observe, when everything in my instinct told me that I should be doing something, I should be lending a hand.

And after eight months, I lost that job. They said I was too emotional. I was too much. But since they didn't want to pay out the contract, they put me on a talk show in Baltimore. And the moment I sat down on that show, the moment I did, I felt like I'd come home. I realized that TV could be more than just a playground, but a platform for service, for helping other people lift their lives. And the moment I sat down, doing that talk show, it felt like breathing. It felt right. And that's where everything that followed for me began.

And I got that lesson. When you're doing the work you're meant to do, it feels right and every day is a bonus, regardless of what you're getting paid.

And how do you know when you're doing something right? How do you know that? It feels so. What I know now is that feelings are really your GPS system for life. When you're supposed to do something or not supposed to do something, your emotional guidance system lets you know. The trick is to learn to check your ego at the door and start checking your gut instead. Every right decision I've made—every right decision I've ever made—has come from my gut. And every wrong decision I've ever made was a result of me not listening to the greater voice of myself.

If it doesn't feel right, don't do it. That's the lesson. And that lesson alone will save you, my friends, a lot of grief. Even doubt means don't.

So, I say to you, forget about the fast lane. If you really want to fly, just harness your power to your passion. Honor your calling. Everybody has one. Trust your heart and success will come to you.

So, how do I define success? Let me tell you, money's pretty nice. I'm not going to stand up here and tell you that it's not about money, 'cause money is very nice. I like money. It's good for buying things.

But having a lot of money does not automatically make you a successful person. What you want is money and meaning. You want your work to be meaningful. Because meaning is what brings the real richness to your life. What you really want is to be surrounded by people you trust and treasure and by people who cherish you. That's when you're really rich.

So, lesson one, follow your feelings. If it feels right, move forward. If it doesn't feel right, don't do it.

Now I want to talk a little bit about failings, because nobody's journey is seamless or smooth. We all stumble. We all have setbacks. If things go wrong, you hit a dead end—as you will—it's just life's way of saying time to change course. So, ask every failure—this is what I do with every failure, every crisis, every difficult time—I say, what is this here to teach me? And as soon as you get the lesson, you get to move on. If you really get the lesson, you pass and you don't have to repeat the class.

And what I've found is that difficulties come when you don't pay attention to life's whisper, because life always whispers to you first. And if you ignore the whisper, sooner or later you'll get a scream. Whatever you resist persists. But, if you ask the right question—not why is this happening, but what is this here to teach me?—it puts you in the place and space to get the lesson you need.

Many of you know that I started this school in Africa. And I founded the school, where I'm trying to give South African girls a shot at a future like yours—Stanford. And yet, last fall, I was faced with a crisis I had never anticipated.

And the whole time I kept asking that question: What is this here to teach me? And, as difficult as that experience has been, I got a lot of lessons. I understand now the mistakes I made, because I had been paying attention to all of the wrong things. I'd built that school from the outside in, when what really mattered was the inside out.

So, it's a lesson that applies to all of our lives as a whole. What matters most is what's inside. What matters most is the sense of integrity, of quality and beauty. I got that lesson.

This is what I know for sure: In order to be truly happy, you must live along with and you have to stand for something larger than yourself. Because life is a reciprocal exchange. To move forward you have to give back. And to me, that is the greatest lesson of life. To be happy, you have to give something back.

The lesson here is clear, and that is, if you're hurting, you need to help somebody ease their hurt. If you're in pain, help somebody else's pain. And when you're in a mess, you get yourself out of the mess helping somebody out of theirs. And in the process, you get to become a member of what I call the greatest fellowship of all, the sorority of compassion and the fraternity of service.

So, whatever field you choose, if you operate from the paradigm of service, I know your life will have more value and you will be happy.

So, let me end with one of my favorite quotes from Martin Luther King. Dr. King said, "Not everybody can be famous. But everybody can be great, because greatness is determined by service." He said, "You don't have to have a college degree to serve. You don't have to make your subject and verb agree to serve. You don't have to know about Plato or Aristotle to serve. You don't have to know Einstein's theory of relativity to serve. You only need a heart full of grace and a soul generated by love."

You have the heart and the smarts to go with it. And it's up to you to decide, really, where will you now use those gifts? You've got the diploma, so go out and get the lessons, 'cause I know great things are sure to come.

Congratulations, '08!`

    fullText: `I'm honored to be with you today for your commencement from one of the finest universities in the world. Truth be told, I never graduated from college. And this is the closest I've ever gotten to a college graduation.

Today I want to tell you three stories from my life. That's it. No big deal. Just three stories.

The first story is about connecting the dots. I dropped out of Reed College after the first six months, but then stayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before I really quit. So why'd I drop out?

It started before I was born. My biological mother was a young, unwed graduate student, and she decided to put me up for adoption. She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates, so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife.

Except that when I popped out, they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl. So my parents, who were on a waiting list, got a call in the middle of the night asking, "We've got an unexpected baby boy. Do you want him?" They said, "Of course."

My biological mother found out later that my mother had never graduated from college, and that my father had never graduated from high school. She refused to sign the final adoption papers. She only relented a few months later, when my parents promised that I would go to college.

And 17 years later I did go to college. But I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford. And all of my working class parents' savings were being spent on my college tuition.

After six months, I couldn't see the value in it. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life, and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out. And here I was, spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life.

So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK. It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made.

The minute I dropped out, I could stop taking the required classes that didn't interest me, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked far more interesting.

It wasn't all romantic. I didn't have a dorm room, so I slept on the floor in friends' rooms. I returned Coke bottles for the five-cent deposits to buy food with. And I would walk the seven miles across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna temple. I loved it.

And much of what I stumbled into, by following my curiosity and intuition, turned out to be priceless later on. Let me give you one example.

Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country. Because I had dropped out, and didn't have to take the normal classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this. I learned about serif and sans-serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle, in a way that science can't capture. And I found it fascinating.

None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life. But ten years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful typography. If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts. And since Windows just copied the Mac, it's likely that no personal computer would have them.

If I had never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on that calligraphy class, and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do. Of course, it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college. But it was very, very clear looking backwards, ten years later.

Again, you can't connect the dots looking forward. You can only connect them looking backwards, so you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something: your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. Because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart, even when it leads you off the well-worn path. And that will make all the difference.

My second story is about love and loss. I was lucky. I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents' garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in ten years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4,000 employees.

We just released our finest creation—the Macintosh—a year earlier, and I'd just turned 30. And then I got fired. How can you get fired from a company you started?

Well, as Apple grew, we hired someone—who I thought was very talented—to run the company with me. And for the first year or so, things went well. But then our visions of the future began to diverge. And eventually we had a falling out. When we did, our board of directors sided with him. And so at 30 I was out, and very publicly out.

What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone, and it was devastating. I really didn't know what to do for a few months. I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down, that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me.

I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce, and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly. I was a very public failure, and I even thought about running away from the Valley.

But something slowly began to dawn on me: I still loved what I did. The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit. I'd been rejected, but I was still in love.

And so I decided to start over.

I didn't see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.

During the next five years, I started a company named NeXT, another company named Pixar, and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife. Pixar went on to create the world's first computer-animated feature film, Toy Story, and is now the most successful animation studio in the world.

In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT, and I returned to Apple. And the technology we developed at NeXT is at the heart of Apple's current renaissance. And Laurene and I have a wonderful family together.

I'm pretty sure none of this would have happened if I hadn't been fired from Apple. It was awful-tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it.

Sometimes life's gonna hit you in the head with a brick. Don't lose faith.

I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did. You've got to find what you love—and that is as true for work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.

If you haven't found it yet, keep looking—and don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. And like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking. Don't settle.

My third story is about death. When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like, "If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you'll most certainly be right."

It made an impression on me. And since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself, "If today were the last day of my life, would I wanna do what I am about to do today?" And whenever the answer has been no for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.

Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything, all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure—these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.

Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.

About a year ago, I was diagnosed with cancer. I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning, and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas. I didn't even know what a pancreas was.

The doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable, and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months. My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order, which is doctors' code for "Prepare to die."

It means to try and tell your kids everything you thought you'd have the next ten years to tell them in just a few months. It means to make sure everything is buttoned up so that it will be as easy as possible for your family. It means to say your goodbyes.

I lived with that diagnosis all day. Later that evening I had a biopsy, where they stuck an endoscope down my throat, through my stomach, and into my intestines, put a needle into my pancreas, and got a few cells from the tumor.

I was sedated, but my wife, who was there, told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope, the doctors started crying because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery. I had the surgery, and thankfully I'm fine now.

This was the closest I've been to facing death, and I hope it's the closest I get for a few more decades. Having lived through it, I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when death was a useful but purely intellectual concept.

No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there. And yet, death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because death is very likely the single best invention of life. It's life's change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new.

Right now, the new is you. But someday, not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away. Sorry to be so dramatic, but it's quite true.

Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma, which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice.

And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.

When I was young, there was an amazing publication called The Whole Earth Catalog, which was one of the bibles of my generation. It was created by a fellow named Stewart Brand, not far from here in Menlo Park. And he brought it to life with his poetic touch.

This was in the late sixties, before personal computers and desktop publishing, so it was all made with typewriters, scissors, and Polaroid cameras. It was sort of like Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along. It was idealistic, overflowing with neat tools and great notions.

Stewart and his team put out several issues of The Whole Earth Catalog. And then, when it had run its course, they put out a final issue. It was the mid-1970s, and I was your age.

On the back cover of their final issue was a photograph of an early-morning country road—the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous. Beneath it were the words "Stay hungry. Stay foolish." It was their farewell message as they signed off.

"Stay hungry. Stay foolish." And I have always wished that for myself. And now, as you graduate to begin anew, I wish that for you.

Stay hungry. Stay foolish.

Thank you all very much.`

Congratulations to all of you…and especially to the magnificent Berkeley graduating class of 2016!

It is a privilege to be here at Berkeley, which has produced so many Nobel Prize winners, Turing Award winners, astronauts, members of Congress, Olympic gold medalists…. and that's just the women!

Berkeley has always been ahead of the times. In the 1960s, you led the Free Speech Movement. Back in those days, people used to say that with all the long hair, how do we even tell the boys from the girls? We now know the answer: manbuns.

Today is a day of celebration. A day to celebrate all the hard work that got you to this moment.

Today is a day of thanks. A day to thank those who helped you get here—nurtured you, taught you, cheered you on, and dried your tears.

Today is a day of reflection. Because today marks the end of one era of your life and the beginning of something new.

A commencement address is meant to be a dance between youth and wisdom. You have the youth. Someone comes in to be the voice of wisdom—that's supposed to be me. I stand up here and tell you all the things I have learned in life, you throw your cap in the air, you let your family take a million photos –don't forget to post them on Instagram —and everyone goes home happy.

Today will be a bit different. We will still do the caps and you still have to do the photos. But I am not here to tell you all the things I've learned in life. Today I will try to tell you what I learned in death.

I have never spoken publicly about this before. It's hard. But I will do my very best not to blow my nose on this beautiful Berkeley robe.

One year and thirteen days ago, I lost my husband, Dave. His death was sudden and unexpected. We were at a friend's fiftieth birthday party in Mexico. I took a nap. Dave went to work out. What followed was the unthinkable—walking into a gym to find him lying on the floor. Flying home to tell my children that their father was gone. Watching his casket being lowered into the ground.

For many months afterward, and at many times since, I was swallowed up in the deep fog of grief—what I think of as the void—an emptiness that fills your heart, your lungs, constricts your ability to think or even to breathe.

Dave's death changed me in very profound ways. I learned about the depths of sadness and the brutality of loss. But I also learned that when life sucks you under, you can kick against the bottom, break the surface, and breathe again. I learned that in the face of the void—or in the face of any challenge—you can choose joy and meaning.

I'm sharing this with you in the hopes that today, as you take the next step in your life, you can learn the lessons that I only learned in death. Lessons about hope, strength, and the light within us that will not be extinguished.

Everyone who has made it through Cal has already experienced some disappointment. You wanted an A but you got a B. OK, let's be honest—you got an A- but you're still mad. You applied for an internship at Facebook, but you only got one from Google. She was the love of your life… but then she swiped left.

You will almost certainly face more and deeper adversity. There's loss of opportunity: the job that doesn't work out, the illness or accident that changes everything in an instant. There's loss of dignity: the sharp sting of prejudice when it happens. There's loss of love: the broken relationships that can't be fixed. And sometimes there's loss of life itself.

The question is not if some of these things will happen to you. They will. Today I want to talk about what happens next. About the things you can do to overcome adversity, no matter what form it takes or when it hits you. The easy days ahead of you will be easy. It is the hard days—the times that challenge you to your very core—that will determine who you are. You will be defined not just by what you achieve, but by how you survive.

A few weeks after Dave died, I was talking to my friend Phil about a father-son activity that Dave was not here to do. We came up with a plan to fill in for Dave. I cried to him, "But I want Dave." Phil put his arm around me and said, "Option A is not available. So let's just kick the shit out of option B."

We all at some point live some form of option B. The question is: What do we do then?

As a representative of Silicon Valley, I'm pleased to tell you there is data to learn from. After spending decades studying how people deal with setbacks, psychologist Martin Seligman found that there are three P's—personalization, pervasiveness, and permanence—that are critical to how we bounce back from hardship. The seeds of resilience are planted in the way we process the negative events in our lives.

The first P is personalization—the belief that we are at fault. This is different from taking responsibility, which you should always do. This is the lesson that not everything that happens to us happens because of us.

When Dave died, I had a very common reaction, which was to blame myself. He died in seconds from a cardiac arrhythmia. I poured over his medical records asking what I could have—or should have—done. It wasn't until I learned about the three P's that I accepted that I could not have prevented his death. His doctors had not identified his coronary artery disease. I was an economics major; how could I have?

The second P is pervasiveness—the belief that an event will affect all areas of your life. You know that song "Everything is awesome?" This is the flip: "Everything is awful." There's no place to run or hide from the all-consuming sadness.

The child psychologists I spoke to encouraged me to get my kids back to their routine as soon as possible. So ten days after Dave died, they went back to school and I went back to work. I remember sitting in my first Facebook meeting in a deep, deep haze. All I could think was, "What is everyone talking about and how could this possibly matter?" But then I got drawn into the discussion and for a second—a brief split second—I forgot about death.

That brief second helped me see that there were other things in my life that were not awful. My children and I were healthy. My friends and family were so loving and they carried us—quite literally at times.

The third P is permanence—the belief that the sorrow will last forever. For months, no matter what I did, it felt like the crushing grief would always be there.

We often project our current feelings out indefinitely—and experience what I think of as the second derivative of those feelings. We feel anxious—and then we feel anxious that we're anxious. We feel sad—and then we feel sad that we're sad. Instead, we should accept our feelings—but recognize that they will not last forever.

But I wish I had known about the three P's when I was your age. There were so many times these lessons would have helped.

The three P's are common emotional reactions to so many things that happen to us—in our careers, our personal lives, and our relationships. You're probably feeling one of them right now about something in your life. But if you can recognize you are falling into these traps, you can catch yourself. Just as our bodies have a physiological immune system, our brains have a psychological immune system—and there are steps you can take to help kick it into gear.

One day my friend Adam Grant, a psychologist, suggested that I think about how much worse things could be. This was completely counterintuitive; it seemed like the way to recover was to try to find positive thoughts. "Worse?" I said. "Are you kidding me? How could things be worse?" His answer cut straight through me: "Dave could have had that same cardiac arrhythmia while he was driving your children." Wow. The moment he said it, I was overwhelmingly grateful that the rest of my family was alive and healthy. That gratitude overtook some of the grief.

Finding gratitude and appreciation is key to resilience. People who take the time to list things they are grateful for are happier and healthier. It turns out that counting your blessings can actually increase your blessings.

As you graduate, can you ask yourselves to live as if you had eleven days left? I don't mean blow everything off and party all the time— although tonight is an exception. I mean live with the understanding of how precious every single day would be. How precious every day actually is.

As I stand here today, a year after the worst day of my life, two things are true. I have a huge reservoir of sadness that is with me always—right here where I can touch it. I never knew I could cry so often—or so much.

But I am also aware that I am walking without pain. For the first time, I am grateful for each breath in and out—grateful for the gift of life itself. I used to celebrate my birthday every five years and friends' birthdays sometimes. Now I celebrate always. I used to go to sleep worrying about all the things I messed up that day—and trust me that list was often quite long. Now I try really hard to focus on each day's moments of joy.

It is the greatest irony of my life that losing my husband helped me find deeper gratitude—gratitude for the kindness of my friends, the love of my family, the laughter of my children. My hope for you is that you can find that gratitude—not just on the good days, like today, but on the hard ones, when you will really need it.

There are so many moments of joy ahead of you. That trip you always wanted to take. A first kiss with someone you really like. The day you get a job doing something you truly believe in. All of these things will happen to you. Enjoy each and every one.

I hope that you live your life—each precious day of it—with joy and meaning. I hope that you walk without pain—and that you are grateful for each step.

And when the challenges come, I hope you remember that anchored deep within you is the ability to learn and grow. You are not born with a fixed amount of resilience. Like a muscle, you can build it up, draw on it when you need it. In that process you will figure out who you really are—and you just might become the very best version of yourself.

Class of 2016, as you leave Berkeley, build resilience.

Build resilience in yourselves. When tragedy or disappointment strike, know that you have the ability to get through absolutely anything. I promise you do. As the saying goes, we are more vulnerable than we ever thought, but we are stronger than we ever imagined.

Build resilient organizations. If anyone can do it, you can, because Berkeley is filled with people who want to make the world a better place. Never stop working to do so—whether it's a boardroom that is not representative or a campus that's not safe. Speak up, especially at institutions like this one, which you hold so dear.

Build resilient communities. We find our humanity—our will to live and our ability to love—in our connections to one another. Be there for your family and friends. And I mean in person. Not just in a message with a heart emoji.

Lift each other up, help each other kick the shit out of option B—and celebrate each and every moment of joy.

You have the whole world in front of you. I can't wait to see what you do with it.

Congratulations, and Go Bears!`

Thank you. Congratulations class of '17. I especially want to thank Chairman Millard, President Reif, distinguished faculty, trustees, and the members of the class of 1967. It is a privilege to be here today with your families and your friends on such on amazing and important day.

MIT and Apple share so much. We both love hard problems. We love the search for new ideas, and we especially love finding those ideas, the really big ones, the ones that can change the world. I know MIT has a proud tradition of pranks or as you would call them, hacks. And you have have pulled off some pretty great ones over the years. I'll never figure out how MIT students sent that Mars rover to the Kresge Oval, or put a propeller beanie on the great dome, or how you've obviously taken over the president's Twitter account. I can tell college students are behind because most of the Tweets happen at 3:00 a.m.

I'm really happy to be here. Today is about celebration. And you have so much to be proud of. As you leave here to start the next leg of your journey in life, there will be days where you ask yourself, 'Where is this all going?' 'What is the purpose?' 'What is my purpose?' I will be honest, I asked myself that same question and it took nearly 15 years to answer it. Maybe by talking about my journey today, I can save you some time.

The struggle for me started early on. In high school, I thought I discovered my life's purpose when I could answer that age-old question, 'What do you want to be when you grow up?' Nope. In college I thought I'd discover it when I could answer, 'What's your major?' Not quite. I thought that maybe I'd discovered it when I found a good job. Then I thought I just needed to get a few promotions. That didn't work either.

I kept convincing myself that it was just over the horizon, around the next corner. Nothing worked. And it was really tearing me apart. Part of me kept pushing ahead to the next achievement. And the other part kept asking, 'Is this all there is?' I went to grad school at Duke looking for the answer. I tried meditation. I sought guidance in religion. I read great philosophers and authors. And in a moment of youthful indiscretion, I might even have experimented with a Windows PC, and obviously that didn't work.

After countless twists and turns, at last, 20 years ago, my search brought me to Apple. At the time, the company was struggling to survive. Steve Jobs had just returned to Apple, and had launched the 'Think Different' campaign. He wanted to empower the crazy ones—the misfits, the rebels and the troublemakers, the round pegs, and the square holes—to do the best work. If we could just do that, Steve knew we could really change the world.

Before that moment, I had never met a leader with such passion or encountered a company with such a clear and compelling purpose: to serve humanity. It was just that simple. Serve humanity. And it was in that moment, after 15 years of searching, something clicked. I finally felt aligned. Aligned with a company that brought together challenging, cutting edge work with a higher purpose. Aligned with a leader who believed that technology which didn't exist yet could reinvent tomorrow's world. Aligned with myself and my own deep need to serve something greater.

Of course, at that moment I don't know all of that. I was just grateful to have psychological burden lifted. But with the help of hindsight, my breakthrough makes a lot more sense. I was never going to find my purpose working some place without a clear sense of purpose of its own. Steve and Apple freed me to throw my whole self into my work, to embrace their mission and make it my own. How can I serve humanity? This is life's biggest and most important question. When you work towards something greater than yourself, you find meaning, you find purpose. So the question I hope you will carry forward from here is how will you serve humanity?

The good news is since you are here today you are on a great track. At MIT you have learned how much power that science and technology have to change the world for the better. Thanks to discoveries made right here, billions of people are leading healthier, more productive and more fulfilling lives. And if we're ever going to solve some of the hardest problems facing the world today, everything from cancer to climate change to educational inequality, then technology will help us to do it. But technology alone isn't the solution. And sometimes it's even part of the problem.

Last year I had the chance to meet with Pope Francis. It was the most incredible meeting of my life. This is a man who has spent more time comforting the inflicted in slums than with heads of state. This may surprise you, but he knew an unbelievable amount about technology. It was obvious to me that he had thought deeply about it. Its opportunity. Its risks. Its morality. What he said to me at that meeting, what he preached, really, was on a topic that we care a lot about at Apple. But he expressed a shared concern in a powerful new way: Never has humanity had such power over itself, yet nothing ensures it will be used wisely, he has said.

Technology today is integral to almost all aspects of our lives and most of the time it's a force for good. And yet the potential adverse consequences are spreading faster and cutting deeper. The threats to security, threats to privacy, fake news, and social media that becomes antisocial. Sometimes the very technology that is meant to connect us divides us. Technology is capable of doing great things. But it doesn't want to do great things. It doesn't want anything. That part takes all of us. It takes our values and our commitment to our families and our neighbors and our communities, our love of beauty and belief that all of our faiths are interconnected, our decency, our kindness.

I'm not worried about artificial intelligence giving computers the ability to think like humans. I'm more concerned about people thinking like computers without values or compassion, without concern for consequences. That is what we need you to help us guard against. Because if science is a search in the darkness, then the humanities are a candle that shows us where we've been and the danger that lies ahead.

As Steve once said, technology alone is not enough. It is technology married with the liberal arts married with the humanities that make our hearts sing. When you keep people at the center of what you do, it can have an enormous impact. It means an iPhone that allows the blind person to run a marathon. It means an Apple Watch that catches a heart condition before it becomes a heart attack. It means an iPad that helps a child with autism connect with his or her world. In short, it means technology infused with your values, making progress possible for everyone.

Whatever you do in your life, and whatever we do at Apple, we must infuse it with the humanity that each of us is born with. That responsibility is immense, but so is the opportunity. I'm optimistic because I believe in your generation, your passion, your journey to serve humanity. We are all counting on you. There is so much out there conspiring to make you cynical. The internet has enabled so much and empowered so many, but it can also be a place where basic rules of decency are suspended and pettiness and negativity thrive.

Don't let that noise knock you off course. Don't get caught up in the trivial aspects of life. Don't listen to trolls and for God's sake don't become one. Measure your impact in humanity not in the likes, but the lives you touch; not in popularity, but in the people you serve. I found that my life got bigger when I stopped carrying about what other people thought about me. You will find yours will too. Stay focused on what really matters. There will be times when your resolve to serve humanity will be tested. Be prepared. People will try to convince you that you should keep your empathy out of your career. Don't accept this false premise.

At a shareholders meeting a few years back, someone questioned Apple's investment and focus on the environment. He asked me to pledge that Apple would only invest in green initiatives that could be justified with a return on investment. I tried to be diplomatic. I pointed out that Apple does many things, like accessibility features for those with disabilities that don't rely on an ROI. We do the things because they are the right thing to do, and protecting the environment is a critical example. He wouldn't let it go and I got my blood up. So I told him, "If you can't accept our position, you shouldn't own Apple stock."

When you are convinced that your cause is right, have the courage to take a stand. If you see a problem or an injustice, recognize that no one will fix it but you. As you go forward today, use your minds and hands and your hearts to build something bigger than yourselves. Always remember there is no idea bigger than this. As Dr. Martin Luther King said, "All life is interrelated. We are all bound together into a single garment of destiny." If you keep that idea at the forefront of all that you do, if you choose to live your lives at that intersection between technology and the people it serves, if you strive to create the best, give the best, do the best for everyone, not just for some, then today all of humanity has good cause for hope.

Thank you very much and congratulations class of 2017!`

    fullText: `President Bok, former President Rudenstine, incoming President Faust, members of the Harvard Corporation and the Board of Overseers, members of the faculty, parents, and especially, the graduates:

I've been waiting more than 30 years to say this: "Dad, I always told you I'd come back and get my degree."

I want to thank Harvard for this timely honor. I'll be changing my job next year … and it will be nice to finally have a college degree on my resume.

I applaud the graduates today for taking a much more direct route to your degrees. For my part, I'm just happy that the Crimson has called me "Harvard's most successful dropout." I guess that makes me valedictorian of my own special class … I did the best of everyone who failed.

Harvard was just a phenomenal experience for me. Academic life was fascinating. I used to sit in on lots of classes I hadn't even signed up for. And dorm life was terrific. I lived up at Radcliffe, in Currier House. There were always lots of people in my dorm room late at night discussing things, because everyone knew I didn't worry about getting up in the morning.

One of my biggest memories of Harvard came in January 1975, when I made a call from Currier House to a company in Albuquerque that had begun making the world's first personal computers. I offered to sell them software.

I worried that they would realize I was just a student in a dorm and hang up on me. Instead they said: "We're not quite ready, come see us in a month," which was a good thing, because we hadn't written the software yet. From that moment, I worked day and night on this little extra credit project that marked the end of my college education and the beginning of a remarkable journey with Microsoft.

What I remember above all about Harvard was being in the midst of so much energy and intelligence. It could be exhilarating, intimidating, sometimes even discouraging, but always challenging. It was an amazing privilege – and though I left early, I was transformed by my years at Harvard, the friendships I made, and the ideas I worked on.

But taking a serious look back … I do have one big regret.

I left Harvard with no real awareness of the awful inequities in the world – the appalling disparities of health, and wealth, and opportunity that condemn millions of people to lives of despair.

I learned a lot here at Harvard about new ideas in economics and politics. I got great exposure to the advances being made in the sciences.

But humanity's greatest advances are not in its discoveries – but in how those discoveries are applied to reduce inequity. Whether through democracy, strong public education, quality health care, or broad economic opportunity – reducing inequity is the highest human achievement.

I left campus knowing little about the millions of young people cheated out of educational opportunities here in this country. And I knew nothing about the millions of people living in unspeakable poverty and disease in developing countries.

It took me decades to find out.

You graduates came to Harvard at a different time. You know more about the world's inequities than the classes that came before. In your years here, I hope you've had a chance to think about how – in this age of accelerating technology – we can finally take on these inequities, and we can solve them.

For Melinda and for me, the challenge is the same: how can we do the most good for the greatest number with the resources we have.

During our discussions on this question, Melinda and I read an article about the millions of children who were dying every year in poor countries from diseases that we had long ago made harmless in this country. Measles, malaria, pneumonia, hepatitis B, yellow fever. One disease I had never even heard of, rotavirus, was killing half a million kids each year – none of them in the United States.

We were shocked. We had just assumed that if millions of children were dying and they could be saved, the world would make it a priority to discover and deliver the medicines to save them. But it did not. For under a dollar, there were interventions that could save lives that just weren't being delivered.

If you believe that every life has equal value, it's revolting to learn that some lives are seen as worth saving and others are not. We said to ourselves: "This can't be true. But if it is true, it deserves to be the priority of our giving."

So we began our work in the same way anyone here would begin it. We asked: "How could the world let these children die?"

The answer is simple, and harsh. The market did not reward saving the lives of these children, and governments did not subsidize it. So the children died because their mothers and their fathers had no power in the market and no voice in the system.

But you and I have both.

We can make market forces work better for the poor if we can develop a more creative capitalism – if we can stretch the reach of market forces so that more people can make a profit, or at least make a living, serving people who are suffering from the worst inequities. We also can press governments around the world to spend taxpayer money in ways that better reflect the values of the people who pay the taxes.

If we can find approaches that meet the needs of the poor in ways that generate profits for business and votes for politicians, we will have found a sustainable way to reduce inequity in the world. This task is open-ended. It can never be finished. But a conscious effort to answer this challenge will change the world.

I am optimistic that we can do this, but I talk to skeptics who claim there is no hope. They say: "Inequity has been with us since the beginning, and will be with us till the end – because people just … don't … care." I completely disagree.

I believe we have more caring than we know what to do with.

All of us here in this Yard, at one time or another, have seen human tragedies that broke our hearts, and yet we did nothing – not because we didn't care, but because we didn't know what to do. If we had known how to help, we would have acted.

The barrier to change is not too little caring; it is too much complexity.

To turn caring into action, we need to see a problem, see a solution, and see the impact. But complexity blocks all three steps.

If we can really see a problem, which is the first step, we come to the second step: cutting through the complexity to find a solution.

Finding solutions is essential if we want to make the most of our caring. If we have clear and proven answers anytime an organization or individual asks "How can I help?," then we can get action – and we can make sure that none of the caring in the world is wasted.

Cutting through complexity to find a solution runs through four predictable stages: determine a goal, find the highest-leverage approach, discover the ideal technology for that approach, and in the meantime, make the smartest application of the technology that you already have — whether it's something sophisticated, like a drug, or something simpler, like a bednet.

The final step – after seeing the problem and finding an approach – is to measure the impact of your work and share your successes and failures so that others learn from your efforts.

You have to have the statistics, of course. You have to be able to show that a program is vaccinating millions more children. You have to be able to show a decline in the number of children dying from these diseases. This is essential not just to improve the program, but also to help draw more investment from business and government.

But if you want to inspire people to participate, you have to show more than numbers; you have to convey the human impact of the work – so people can feel what saving a life means to the families affected.

Still, I'm optimistic. Yes, inequity has been with us forever, but the new tools we have to cut through complexity have not been with us forever. They are new – they can help us make the most of our caring – and that's why the future can be different from the past.

The defining and ongoing innovations of this age – biotechnology, the computer, the Internet – give us a chance we've never had before to end extreme poverty and end death from preventable disease.

Members of the Harvard Family: Here in the Yard is one of the great collections of intellectual talent in the world.

What for?

There is no question that the faculty, the alumni, the students, and the benefactors of Harvard have used their power to improve the lives of people here and around the world. But can we do more? Can Harvard dedicate its intellect to improving the lives of people who will never even hear its name?

Let me make a request of the deans and the professors – the intellectual leaders here at Harvard: As you hire new faculty, award tenure, review curriculum, and determine degree requirements, please ask yourselves:

Should our best minds be dedicated to solving our biggest problems?

Should Harvard encourage its faculty to take on the world's worst inequities? Should Harvard students learn about the depth of global poverty … the prevalence of world hunger … the scarcity of clean water …the girls kept out of school … the children who die from diseases we can cure?

Should the world's most privileged people learn about the lives of the world's least privileged?

These are not rhetorical questions – you will answer with your policies.

My mother, who was filled with pride the day I was admitted here – never stopped pressing me to do more for others. A few days before my wedding, she hosted a bridal event, at which she read aloud a letter about marriage that she had written to Melinda. My mother was very ill with cancer at the time, but she saw one more opportunity to deliver her message, and at the close of the letter she said: "From those to whom much is given, much is expected."

When you consider what those of us here in this Yard have been given – in talent, privilege, and opportunity – there is almost no limit to what the world has a right to expect from us.

In line with the promise of this age, I want to exhort each of the graduates here to take on an issue – a complex problem, a deep inequity, and become a specialist on it. If you make it the focus of your career, that would be phenomenal. But you don't have to do that to make an impact. For a few hours every week, you can use the growing power of the Internet to get informed, find others with the same interests, see the barriers, and find ways to cut through them.

Don't let complexity stop you. Be activists. Take on the big inequities. It will be one of the great experiences of your lives.

You graduates are coming of age in an amazing time. As you leave Harvard, you have technology that members of my class never had. You have awareness of global inequity, which we did not have. And with that awareness, you likely also have an informed conscience that will torment you if you abandon these people whose lives you could change with very little effort. You have more than we had; you must start sooner, and carry on longer.

Knowing what you know, how could you not?

And I hope you will come back here to Harvard 30 years from now and reflect on what you have done with your talent and your energy. I hope you will judge yourselves not on your professional accomplishments alone, but also on how well you have addressed the world's deepest inequities … on how well you treated people a world away who have nothing in common with you but their humanity.

Good luck.`

    fullText: `President Faust, members of the Harvard Corporation and the Board of Overseers, members of the faculty, proud parents, and, above all, graduates.

The first thing I would like to say is 'thank you.' Not only has Harvard given me an extraordinary honour, but the weeks of fear and nausea I have endured at the thought of giving this commencement address have made me lose weight. A win-win situation! Now all I have to do is take deep breaths, squint at the red banners and convince myself that I am at the world's largest Gryffindor reunion.

Delivering a commencement address is a great responsibility; or so I thought until I cast my mind back to my own graduation. The commencement speaker that day was the distinguished British philosopher Baroness Mary Warnock. Reflecting on her speech has helped me enormously in writing this one, because it turns out that I can't remember a single word she said. This liberating discovery enables me to proceed without any fear that I might inadvertently influence you to abandon promising careers in business, the law or politics for the giddy delights of becoming a gay wizard.

Actually, I have wracked my mind and heart for what I ought to say to you today. I have asked myself what I wish I had known at my own graduation, and what important lessons I have learned in the 21 years that have expired between that day and this.

I have come up with two answers. On this wonderful day when we are gathered together to celebrate your academic success, I have decided to talk to you about the benefits of failure. And as you stand on the threshold of what is sometimes called 'real life', I want to extol the crucial importance of imagination.

Looking back at the 21-year-old that I was at graduation, is a slightly uncomfortable experience for the 42-year-old that she has become. Half my lifetime ago, I was striking an uneasy balance between the ambition I had for myself, and what those closest to me expected of me.

I was convinced that the only thing I wanted to do, ever, was to write novels. However, my parents, both of whom came from impoverished backgrounds and neither of whom had been to college, took the view that my overactive imagination was an amusing personal quirk that would never pay a mortgage, or secure a pension.

What I feared most for myself at your age was not poverty, but failure.

At your age, in spite of a distinct lack of motivation at university, where I had spent far too long in the coffee bar writing stories, and far too little time at lectures, I had a knack for passing examinations, and that, for years, had been the measure of success in my life and that of my peers.

However, the fact that you are graduating from Harvard suggests that you are not very well-acquainted with failure. You might be driven by a fear of failure quite as much as a desire for success. Indeed, your conception of failure might not be too far from the average person's idea of success, so high have you already flown.

Ultimately, we all have to decide for ourselves what constitutes failure, but the world is quite eager to give you a set of criteria if you let it. So I think it fair to say that by any conventional measure, a mere seven years after my graduation day, I had failed on an epic scale. An exceptionally short-lived marriage had imploded, and I was jobless, a lone parent, and as poor as it is possible to be in modern Britain, without being homeless.

Now, I am not going to stand here and tell you that failure is fun. That period of my life was a dark one, and I had no idea that there was going to be what the press has since represented as a kind of fairy tale resolution.

So why do I talk about the benefits of failure? Simply because failure meant a stripping away of the inessential. I stopped pretending to myself that I was anything other than what I was, and began to direct all my energy into finishing the only work that mattered to me. Had I really succeeded at anything else, I might never have found the determination to succeed in the one arena I believed I truly belonged. I was set free, because my greatest fear had been realised, and I was still alive, and I still had a daughter whom I adored, and I had an old typewriter and a big idea. And so rock bottom became the solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life.

You might never fail on the scale I did, but some failure in life is inevitable. It is impossible to live without failing at something, unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all – in which case, you fail by default.

Failure gave me an inner security that I had never attained by passing examinations. Failure taught me things about myself that I could have learned no other way. I discovered that I had a strong will, and more discipline than I had suspected; I also found out that I had friends whose value was truly above the price of rubies.

The knowledge that you have emerged wiser and stronger from setbacks means that you are, ever after, secure in your ability to survive. You will never truly know yourself, or the strength of your relationships, until both have been tested by adversity.

Now you might think that I chose my second theme, the importance of imagination, because of the part it played in rebuilding my life, but that is not wholly so. Imagination is not only the uniquely human capacity to envision that which is not, and therefore the fount of all invention and innovation. In its arguably most transformative and revelatory capacity, it is the power that enables us to empathise with humans whose experiences we have never shared.

One of the greatest formative experiences of my life preceded Harry Potter, though it informed much of what I subsequently wrote in those books. This revelation came in the form of one of my earliest day jobs. Though I was sloping off to write stories during my lunch hours, I paid the rent in my early 20s by working at the African research department at Amnesty International's headquarters in London.

There in my little office I read hastily scribbled letters smuggled out of totalitarian regimes by men and women who were risking imprisonment to inform the outside world of what was happening to them. I saw photographs of those who had disappeared without trace, sent to Amnesty by their desperate families and friends.

Every day of my working week in my early 20s I was reminded how incredibly fortunate I was, to live in a country with a democratically elected government, where legal representation and a public trial were the rights of everyone.

And yet I also learned more about human goodness at Amnesty International than I had ever known before.

Amnesty mobilises thousands of people who have never been tortured or imprisoned for their beliefs to act on behalf of those who have. The power of human empathy, leading to collective action, saves lives, and frees prisoners. Ordinary people, whose personal well-being and security are assured, join together in huge numbers to save people they do not know, and will never meet.

Unlike any other creature on this planet, humans can learn and understand, without having experienced. They can think themselves into other people's places.

Of course, this is a power, like my brand of fictional magic, that is morally neutral. One might use such an ability to manipulate, or control, just as much as to understand or sympathise.

And many prefer not to exercise their imaginations at all. They choose to remain comfortably within the bounds of their own experience, never troubling to wonder how it would feel to have been born other than they are.

What is more, those who choose not to empathise enable real monsters. For without ever committing an act of outright evil ourselves, we collude with it, through our own apathy.

One of the many things I learned at the end of that Classics corridor down which I ventured at the age of 18, in search of something I could not then define, was this, written by the Greek author Plutarch: What we achieve inwardly will change outer reality.

But how much more are you, Harvard graduates of 2008, likely to touch other people's lives? Your intelligence, your capacity for hard work, the education you have earned and received, give you unique status, and unique responsibilities.

If you choose to use your status and influence to raise your voice on behalf of those who have no voice; if you choose to identify not only with the powerful, but with the powerless; if you retain the ability to imagine yourself into the lives of those who do not have your advantages, then it will not only be your proud families who celebrate your existence, but thousands and millions of people whose reality you have helped change. We do not need magic to change the world, we carry all the power we need inside ourselves already: we have the power to imagine better.

I am nearly finished. I have one last hope for you, which is something that I already had at 21. The friends with whom I sat on graduation day have been my friends for life.

So today, I wish you nothing better than similar friendships. And tomorrow, I hope that even if you remember not a single word of mine, you remember those of Seneca, another of those old Romans I met when I fled down the Classics corridor, in retreat from career ladders, in search of ancient wisdom:

As is a tale, so is life: not how long it is, but how good it is, is what matters.

I wish you all very good lives. Thank-you very much.`

    fullText: `Thank you very much. I am obviously the most unorganized. Everybody else has nice boxes to bring their script up in. I just got it all messed up here and put it inside of a magazine.

President Gutmann, Provost Price, Board Chair Cohen, fellow honorees, beautiful honorees, and today's graduates. I'm honored and grateful for the invitation today. It's always been great to be on the Penn campus. I've been here before a lot of times for basketball games. My son played on the basketball team.

But I'll be honest with you. I'm a little nervous. I'm not used to speaking at a graduation of this magnitude. It's a little overwhelming. It's out of my comfort zone. You dress me up in army fatigues or throw me on top of a moving train that someone said unstoppable, or ask me to play Malcolm X, Rubin Hurricane Carter, or Alonzo from Training Day, I can do that. But a commencement speech, it's a very serious affair, and it's a very different ball game.

I was thinking about this speech, what I should say. I figured the best way to keep your attention would be to talk about something, really juicy Hollywood stuff. But I said, no, no, no. You're a group of high-minded intellectuals.

So I was back to square one, feeling the pressure. So, now you're probably thinking if it was going to be this difficult, this is much pressure, why did I even accept today's invitation in the first place? Well, my son goes here, that's number one. That's a good reason. And I always like to check to see how my money's being spent.

So I had to be here. I had to come, even though I was afraid I might make a fool of myself. In fact, if you really want to know the truth, I had to come exactly because I might make a fool of myself. Now, what am I talking about? Here it is.

I found that nothing in life is worthwhile unless you take risks. Nothing. Nelson Mandela said, "There is no passion to be found, playing small and settling for a life that's less than the one you're capable of living."

Now, I'm sure in your experiences in school and applying to college and picking your major and deciding what you want to do with life, I'm sure people have told you to make sure you have something to fall back on. Make sure you got something to fall back on, honey. But I never understood that concept, having something to fall back on. If I'm going to fall, I don't want to fall back on anything except my faith. I want to fall forward. I figure at least this way, I'll see what I'm going to hit.

Fall forward. This is what I mean. Reggie Jackson struck out 2,600 times in his career, the most in the history of baseball, but you don't hear about the strikeouts. People remember the home runs. Fall forward.

Thomas Edison conducted 1000 failed experiments. Did you know that? I didn't know that. Because the 1001st was the light bulb. Fall forward.

Every failed experiment is one step closer to success. You've got to take risks, and I'm sure you've probably heard that before, but I want to talk to you about why that's so important. I got three reasons.

First, you will fail at some point in your life. Accept it. You will lose. You will embarrass yourself. You will suck at something. There's no doubt about it. And I know that's probably not a traditional message for a graduation ceremony, but hey, I'm telling you embrace it because it's inevitable. And I should know. In the acting business, you fail all the time.

Early on in my career, I auditioned for a part in a Broadway musical. Perfect role for me, I thought, except for the fact that I can't sing. So, I'm in the wings. I'm about to go on stage, but the guy in front of me, he's singing like Pavarotti. And I'm just shrinking. I'm getting smaller and smaller.

I didn't get the job. But here's the thing. I didn't quit. I didn't fall back. I walked out of there to prepare for the next audition and the next audition and the next audition. I prayed. I prayed and I prayed. But I continued to fail and fail and fail. But it didn't matter because you know what? There's an old saying, you hang around the barbershop long enough, sooner or later, you're going to get a haircut. So you will catch a break. And I did catch a break.

Last year, I did a play called Fences on Broadway. Won the Tony Award. And I didn't have to sing, by the way. But here's the kicker. It was at the Cort Theatre. It was at the same theater that I failed that first audition, 30 years prior.

The point is, every graduate here today has the training and the talent to succeed. But do you have the guts to fail?

Here's my second point about failure. If you don't fail, you're not even trying. I'll say it again. If you don't fail, you're not even trying. My wife told me this great expression. To get something you never had, you have to do something you never did.

So I ask you today, how many ghosts are going to be around your bed when your time comes? You've invested a lot in your education, and people have invested in you. And let me tell you, the world needs your talents. Man, does it ever. The world needs a lot, and we need it from you. We really do. We need it from you young people.

So you got to get out there. You got to give it everything you got, whether it's your time, your talent, your prayers, or your treasures. Because remember this, you will never see a U-Haul behind a hearse. I'll say it again. You will never see a U-Haul behind a hearse. You can't take it with you. The Egyptians tried it, and all they got was robbed.

So the question is, what are you going to do with what you have? I'm not talking about how much you have. Some of you are business majors. Some of you were theologians, nurses, sociologists. Some of you have money. Some of you have patience. Some of you have kindness. Some of you have love. Some of you have the gift of long-suffering. Whatever it is, whatever your gift is, what are you going to do with what you have?

All right. Now, here's my last point about failure. Sometimes it's the best way to figure out where you're going. Your life will never be a straight path. I began at Fordham University as a pre-med student. I took a course called cardiac morphogenesis. I couldn't read it. I couldn't say it. I sure couldn't pass it.

So then I decided to go into pre-law, then journalism. And with no academic focus, my grades took off in their own direction. Yeah, down. I was a 1.8 GPA one semester. And the university very politely suggested that it might be better to take some time off. I was 20 years old. I was at my lowest point.

And then one day, and I remember the exact day, March 27, 1975, I was helping my mother in her beauty shop. My mother owned a beauty shop up in Mount Vernon. And there was this older woman who was considered one of the elders in the town. And I didn't know her personally, but I was looking in a mirror and every time I looked at the mirror, I could see her behind me. And she was staring at me.

So she finally took the dryer off her head, and she said something I'll never forget. First of all, she said, "Somebody give me a piece of paper. Give me a piece of paper." She said, "Young boy, I have a prophecy, a spiritual prophecy." She said, "You are going to travel the world and speak to millions of people."

Now mind you, I'm 20 years old. I'm flunked out of school. But maybe she was onto something. Because later that summer, while working as a counselor to YMCA camp in Connecticut, we put on a talent show for the campus. And after the show, another counselor that came up to me and asked, "Had you ever thought about acting? You're good at that."

So when I got back to Fordham that fall, I got in and I changed my major once again, for the last time. And in the years that followed, just as that woman prophesied, I have traveled the world, and I have spoken to millions of people through my movies. But I see you today. And I'm encouraged by what I see. And I'm strengthened by what I see. And I love what I see.

So members of the class of 2011, this is your mission. When you leave the friendly confines of Philly, never be discouraged, never hold back, give everything you got. And when you fall throughout life, remember this: fall forward.

Congratulations. I love you. God bless you. I respect you.`

    fullText: `Thank you so much, thank you so much. Thank you, President Cowan, Mrs. President Cowen; distinguished guests, undistinguished guests, you know who you are, honored faculty and creepy Spanish teacher. And thank you to all the graduating Class of 2009, I realize most of you are hungover and have splitting headaches and haven't slept since Fat Tuesday, but you can't graduate 'til I finish, so listen up.

When I was asked to make the commencement speech, I immediately said yes. Then I went to look up what commencement meant, which would have been easy if I had a dictionary, but most of the books in our house are Portia's, and they're all written in Australian. So I had to break the word down myself, to find out the meaning.

I thought that you had to be a famous alumnus, alumini, aluminum, alumis; you had to graduate from this school. And I didn't go to college here, and I don't know if President Cowan knows, I didn't go to any college at all, any college. And I'm not saying you wasted your time, or money, but look at me, I'm a huge celebrity.

Although I did graduate from the school of hard knocks, our mascot was the knockers. I spent a lot of time here growing up. My mom worked at Newcomb and I would go there every time I needed to steal something out of her purse.

But why am I here today? Clearly not to steal, you're too far away and I'd never get away with it. I'm here because of you. Because I can't think of a more tenacious, more courageous graduating class. I mean, look at you all, wearing your robes. Usually when you're wearing a robe at 10 in the morning, it means you've given up.

I'm here because I love New Orleans. I was born and raised here, I spent my formative years here, and like you, while I was living here I only did laundry six times. When I finished school, I was completely lost and by school, I mean middle school, but I went ahead and finished high school anyway. And I really, I had no ambition; I didn't know what I wanted to do. I did everything from: I shucked oysters, I was a hostess, I was a bartender, I was a waitress, I painted houses, I sold vacuum cleaners; I had no idea and I thought I'd just finally settle in some job and I would make enough money to pay my rent, maybe have basic cable, maybe not, I didn't really have a plan.

My point is that, by the time I was your age, I really thought I knew who I was but I had no idea. Like for example, when I was your age, I was dating men. So what I'm saying is, when you're older, most of you will be gay. Is anybody writing this stuff down? Parents?

Anyway, I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and the way I ended up on this path was from a very tragic event. I was maybe 19, and my girlfriend at the time was killed in a car accident. And I passed the accident, and I didn't know it was her and I kept going and I found out shortly after that, it was her.

And I was living in a basement apartment; I had no money; I had no heat, no air, I had a mattress on the floor and the apartment was infested with fleas. And I was soul-searching, I was like, why is she suddenly gone, and there are fleas here? I don't understand, there must be a purpose and wouldn't it be so convenient if we could pick up the phone and call God and ask these questions.

And I started writing and what poured out of me was an imaginary conversation with God, which was one-sided and I finished writing it and I looked at it and I said to myself, and I hadn't even been doing stand-up, ever, there was no club in town. I said, "I'm going do this on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson" – at the time he was the king – "and I'm going be the first woman in the history of the show to be called over to sit down." And several years later, I was the first woman in the history of the show, and only woman in the history of the show to sit down, because of that phone conversation with God that I wrote.

And I started this path of stand-up, and it was successful and it was great, but it was hard because I was trying to please everybody and I had this secret that I was keeping, that I was gay. And I thought if people found out they wouldn't like me, they wouldn't laugh at me. Then my career turned… I got my own sitcom, and that was very successful, another level of success. And I thought, what if they find out I'm gay, then they'll never watch, and this was a long time ago, this was when we just had white presidents. But anyway, this was back many years ago.

And I finally decided that I was living with so much shame, and so much fear, that I just couldn't live that way anymore and I decided to come out and make it creative. And my character would come out at the same time, and it wasn't to make a political statement, it wasn't to do anything other than to free myself up from this heaviness that I was carrying around, and I just wanted to be honest. And I thought, "What's the worst that could happen? I can lose my career." I did. I lost my career. The show was cancelled after six years without even telling me; I read it in the paper. The phone didn't ring for three years. I had no offers. Nobody wanted to touch me at all.

Yet, I was getting letters from kids that almost committed suicide, but didn't because of what I did. And I realized that I had a purpose. And it wasn't just about me and it wasn't about celebrity, but I felt like I was being punished and it was a bad time, I was angry, I was sad, and then I was offered a talk show. And the people that offered me the talk show tried to sell it. And most stations didn't want to pick it up. Most people didn't want to buy it because they thought nobody would watch me.

Really when I look back on it, I wouldn't change a thing. I mean, it was so important for me to lose everything because I found out what the most important thing is, is to be true to yourself. Ultimately, that's what's gotten me to this place. I don't live in fear, I'm free; I have no secrets and I know I'll always be OK, because no matter what, I know who I am.

So in conclusion, when I was younger I thought success was something different. I thought when I grow up, I want to be famous. I want to be a star. I want to be in movies. When I grow up I want to see the world, drive nice cars, I want to have groupies. To quote the Pussycat Dolls. How many people thought it was "boobies", by the way? It's not, it's "groupies".

But my idea of success is different today. And as you grow, you'll realize the definition of success changes. For many of you, today, success is being able to hold down 20 shots of tequila. For me, the most important thing in your life is to live your life with integrity and not to give into peer pressure to try to be something that you're not, to live your life as an honest and compassionate person, to contribute in some way. So to conclude my conclusion, follow your passion, stay true to yourself. Never follow anyone else's path, unless you're in the woods and you're lost and you see a path and by all means you should follow that.

Don't give advice, it will come back and bite you in the ass. Don't take anyone's advice. So my advice to you is to be true to yourself and everything will be fine. And I know that a lot of you are concerned about your future, but there's no need to worry. The economy is booming, the job market is wide open, the planet is just fine. It's going be great.

You've already survived a hurricane. What else can happen to you? And as I mentioned before, some of the most devastating things that happen to you will teach you the most. And now you know the right questions to ask in your first job interview. Like, "Is it above sea level?"

So to conclude my conclusion that I've previously concluded, in the common cement speech, I guess what I'm trying to say is life is like one big Mardi Gras. But instead of showing your boobs, show people your brain, and if they like what they see, you'll have more beads than you know what to do with and you'll be drunk, most of the time.

So the Katrina class of 2009, I say congratulations, and if you don't remember a thing I said today, remember this, you're going to be OK, dum de dumdumdum, just dance.`

I pray I never witness a more damning example of what is wrong with America today.

Graduates, faculty, parents, relatives, undergraduates, and old people that just come to these things - Good morning and congratulations to the Dartmouth Class of 2011. Today, you have achieved something special - something only 92 percent of Americans your age will ever know: a college diploma. That's right, with your college diploma you now have a crushing advantage over 8 percent of the workforce. I'm talking about dropout losers like Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and Mark Zuckerberg.

My first job as your commencement speaker is to illustrate that life is not fair. For example, you have worked tirelessly for four years to earn the diploma you'll be receiving this weekend, and Dartmouth is giving me the same degree for interviewing the fourth lead in Twilight. Deal with it.

I would like to thank President Kim for inviting me here today. But this is a wonderful occasion and it is great to be here in New Hampshire, where I am getting an honorary degree and all the legal fireworks I can fit in the trunk of my car.

To communicate with you students today, I have gone to great lengths to become well-versed in your unique linguistic patterns. Your school motto is "Vox Clamantis in Deserto," which means "Voice Crying Out in the Wilderness." This is easily the most pathetic school motto I have ever heard. Apparently, it narrowly beat out "Silently Weeping in Thick Shrub" and "Whimpering in Moist Leaves without Pants."

Your school color is green, and this color was chosen by Frederick Mather in 1867 because, and this is true, "it was the only color that had not been taken already." I cannot remember hearing anything so sad. Dartmouth, you have an inferiority complex, and you should not.

No, Dartmouth, you must stand tall. Raise your heads high and feel proud.

Because if Harvard, Yale, and Princeton are your self-involved, vain, name-dropping older brothers, you are the cool, sexually confident, Lacrosse playing younger sibling who knows how to throw a party and looks good in a down vest. Brown, of course, is your lesbian sister who never leaves her room. And Penn, Columbia, and Cornell... well, frankly, who gives a shit.

Yes, I've always had a special bond with this school. But fate dealt a heavy blow. With no money, I was forced to enroll in a small, local commuter school, a pulsating sore on a muddy elbow of the Charles River. I was a miserable wretch, and to this day I cannot help but wonder: What if I had gone to Dartmouth?

You are a great school, and you deserve a historic commencement address. That's right, I want my message today to be forever remembered because it changed the world. To do this, I must suggest groundbreaking policy. I call it The Conan Doctrine.

Besides policy, another hallmark of great commencement speeches is deep, profound advice like "reach for the stars." Well today, I am not going to waste your time with empty clichés. Instead, I am going to give you real, practical advice that you will need to know if you are going to survive the next few years.

First, adult acne lasts longer than you think. Guys: this is important -- you cannot iron a shirt while wearing it. If you live on Ramen Noodles for too long, you lose all feeling in your hands. And finally, wearing colorful Converse high-tops beneath your graduation robe is a great way to tell your classmates that this is just the first of many horrible decisions you plan to make with your life.

Yes, you parents must be patient because it is indeed a grim job market out there. And one of the reasons that it's so tough finding work is that aging baby boomers refuse to leave their jobs. Trust me on this. Even when they promise you for five years that they are going to leave... and say it on television... there is no guarantee they won't come back.

But enough. This is not a time for grim prognostications or negativity. No, I came here today because, believe it or not, I actually do have something real to tell you.

Eleven years ago I gave an address to a graduating class at Harvard. I have not spoken at a graduation since because I thought I had nothing left to say. But then 2010 came. And now I'm here, three thousand miles from my home, because I learned a hard but profound lesson last year and I'd like to share it with you.

In 2000, I told graduates "Don't be afraid to fail." Well now I'm here to tell you that, though you should not fear failure, you should do your very best to avoid it. Nietzsche famously said "Whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger." But what he failed to stress is that IT ALMOST KILLS YOU. Disappointment stings and, for driven, successful people like yourselves it is disorienting.

By definition, Commencement speakers at an Ivy League college are considered successful. But a little over a year ago, I experienced a profound and very public disappointment. I did not get what I wanted, and I left a system that had nurtured and help define me for the better part of seventeen years.

But then something spectacular happened. Fogbound, with no compass, and adrift, I started trying things. I grew a strange, cinnamon beard. I dove into the world of social media and started tweeting my comedy. I threw together a national tour. I played the guitar, did stand-up, wore a skin-tight blue leather suit, recorded an album, made a documentary, and frightened my friends and family.

Ultimately, I abandoned all preconceived perceptions of my career path and stature and took a job on basic cable with a network most famous for showing re-runs. I did a lot of silly, unconventional, spontaneous and seemingly irrational things and guess what - with the exception of the blue leather suit, it was the most satisfying and fascinating year of my professional life.

How could this be true? It's simple: there are few things more liberating in this life than having your worst fear realized.

Your path at 22 will not necessarily be your path at 32 or 42. One's dream is constantly evolving, rising and falling, changing course. This happens in every job, but because I have worked in comedy for twenty five years, I can speak best about my own profession.

It is our failure to become our perceived ideal that ultimately defines us and makes us unique. It's not easy, but if you accept your misfortune and handle it right, your perceived failure can be a catalyst for profound re-invention.

So, at the age of 47, after 25 years of obsessively pursuing my dream, that dream changed. For decades, in show business, the ultimate goal of every comedian was to host The Tonight Show. It was the Holy Grail, and like many people I thought that achieving that goal would define me as successful. But that is not true. No specific job or career goal defines me and it should not define you.

In 2000, I told graduates to not be afraid to fail, and I still believe that. But today I tell you that whether you fear it or not, disappointment will come. The beauty is that through disappointment you can gain clarity, and with clarity comes conviction and true originality.

Many of you here today are getting your diploma at this Ivy League school because you have committed yourself to a dream and worked hard to achieve it. And there is no greater cliché in a commencement address than "follow your dream." Well I am here to tell you that whatever you think your dream is now, it will probably change. And that's okay.

Four years ago, many of you had a specific vision of what your college experience was going to be and who you were going to become. And I bet, today, most of you would admit that your time here was very different from what you imagined. But through the good and especially the bad, the person you are now is someone you could never have conjured in the fall of 2007.

I have told you many things today, most of it foolish but some of it true. I'd like to end my address by breaking a taboo and quoting myself from 17 months ago. At the end of my final program with NBC, just before signing off, I said "Work hard, be kind, and amazing things will happen." Today, receiving this honor and speaking to the Dartmouth Class of 2011 from behind a tree-trunk, I have never believed that more.

Thank you very much, and congratulations.`

    fullText: `Good morning President Bienen, the Board of Trustees, faculty, parents, family, friends, and the Class of 2006. Congratulations on your graduation, and thank you for allowing me the honor to be a part of it.

A few months ago, I came across an article in your student newspaper by Elaine Meyer. So, Elaine wrote this article entitled, "Challenge us, Senator Obama." I thought this seemed like a fair request, so I kept reading. And I noticed that Elaine set out a few expectations for this speech.

According to the article, I'm supposed to be inspirational, but not contrived. I'm supposed to be hopeful, but not cheesy. I should be political, but not too political.

And what she wrote next is precisely what I'd like to talk you about today. She said, "When people say they don't want to hear about politics in a commencement address, they are in part speaking of not wanting to hear about the outside world and its problems. We students have been insulated enough for the past four years that it shouldn't hurt us to be challenged for thirty minutes, especially on a day that marks our commencement into the 'real' world."

That struck me as an important statement. And it called to mind a passage from scriptures that some of you may know: Corinthians 13:11: "When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I felt as a child, I thought as a child. Now that I have become a man, I have put away childish things."

I bring this up because there's an assumption in rites of passage like this that growing up is just a function of age; that becoming an adult is an inevitable and natural progression. But in fact, I know a whole lot of thirty year olds and forty year olds and fifty year olds who are not yet full-grown.

So even today, as a U.S. Senator, I have to remind myself of certain lessons from my own youth - lessons about growing up and being true to my values and ideals.

The first lesson came during my first year in college. Back then I had a tendency, in my mother's words, to act a bit casual about my future. I rebelled, angry in the way that many young men in general, and young black man in particular, are angry, thinking that responsibility and hard work were old-fashioned conventions that didn't apply to me. I partied a little too much and studied just enough to get by.

And once, after a particularly long night of partying, we had spilled a little too much beer, broke a few too many bottles, and trashed a little too much of the dorm. And the next day, the mess was so bad that when one of the cleaning ladies saw it, she began to tear up. And when a girlfriend of mine heard about this, she said to me, "That woman could've been my grandmother, Barack. She spent her days cleaning up after somebody else's mess."

Which drove home for me the first lesson of growing up: The world doesn't just revolve around you. There's a lot of talk in this country about the federal deficit. But I think we should talk more about our empathy deficit - the ability to put ourselves in someone else's shoes; to see the world through those who are different from us - the child who's hungry, the laid-off steelworker, the immigrant woman cleaning your dorm room.

As you go on in life, cultivating this quality of empathy will become harder, not easier. There's no community service requirement in the real world; no one forcing you to care. You'll be free to live in neighborhoods with people who are exactly like yourself, and send your kids to the same schools, and narrow your concerns to what's going in your own little circle.

Not only that - we live in a culture that discourages empathy. A culture that too often tells us our principle goal in life is to be rich, thin, young, famous, safe, and entertained. A culture where those in power too often encourage these selfish impulses.

I hope you don't listen to this. I hope you choose to broaden, and not contract, your ambit of concern. Not because you have an obligation to those who are less fortunate, although you do have that obligation. Not because you have a debt to all of those who helped you get to where you are, although you do have that debt.

It's because you have an obligation to yourself. Because our individual salvation depends on collective salvation. And because it's only when you hitch your wagon to something larger than yourself that you will realize your true potential - and become full-grown.

The second lesson I learned after college, when I had this crazy idea that I wanted to be a community organizer and work in low-income neighborhoods. My mother and grandparents thought I should go to law school. My friends had applied for jobs on Wall Street. But I went ahead and wrote letters to every organization in the country that I could think of.

Even people who didn't know me were skeptical of my decision. I remember having a conversation with an older man I had met before I arrived in Chicago. I told him about my plans, and he looked at me and said, "Let me tell something. You look like a nice clean-cut young man, and you've got a nice voice. So let me give you a piece of advice - forget this community organizing business. You can't change the world, and people won't appreciate you trying. What you should do is go into television broadcasting. I'm telling you, you've got a future."

But I knew there was something in me that wanted to try for something bigger.

So the second lesson is this: Challenge yourself. Take some risks in your life.

This may be difficult for all of you because one of the great things about graduating from Northwestern is that you can now punch your own ticket. You can take your diploma, walk off this stage, and go chasing after the big house and the large salary and the nice suits and all the other things that our money culture says you should buy.

But I hope you don't. Focusing your life solely on making a buck shows a poverty of ambition. It asks too little of yourself. And it will leave you unfulfilled.

So don't let people talk you into doing the safe thing. Listen to what's inside of you and decide what it is that you care about so much that you're willing to risk it all.

The third lesson is one that I learned once I got to Chicago. I had spent weeks organizing our very first community meeting around the issue of gang violence. The night of the meeting we arranged rows and rows of chairs in anticipation of the crowd. And we waited. And we waited. And finally, a group of older people walk in to the hall. And they sit down. And this little old lady raises her hand and asks, "Is this where the bingo game is?"

Thirteen people showed up that night. The police never came. And the meeting was a complete disaster. Later, the volunteers I worked with told me they were quitting - that they had been doing this for two years and had nothing to show for it.

I was tired too. But at that point, I looked outside and saw some young boys playing in a vacant lot across the street, tossing stones at boarded-up apartment building. And I turned to the volunteers, and I asked them, "Before you quit, I want you to answer one question. What's gonna happen to those boys? Who will fight for them if not us? Who will give them a fair shot if we leave?" And at that moment, we were all reminded of a third lesson in growing up: Persevere.

Making your mark on the world is hard. If it were easy, everybody would do it. But it's not. It takes patience, it takes commitment, and it comes with plenty of failure along the way. The real test is not whether you avoid this failure, because you won't. it's whether you let it harden or shame you into inaction, or whether you learn from it; whether you choose to persevere.

Cultivating empathy, challenging yourself, persevering in the face of adversity - these are the qualities that I've found to be important in my own life. But what's true for individuals can also be true for nations.

For what America needs right now, more than ever, is a sense of purpose to guide us through the challenges that lie ahead; a maturity that we seem to have lost somewhere along the way; a willingness to engage in a sober, adult conversation about our future.

Each and every one of these challenges call for an America that is more purposeful, more grown-up than the America that we have today. An America that reflects the lessons that have helped so many of its people mature in their own lives. An America that's about not just each of us, but all of us. An America that takes great risks in the face of greater odds. An America that, above all, perseveres.

And now it is 2006. And here you sit facing challenges as great as any in the past. And the choice is yours. Will the years pass with barely a whisper from your generation? Or will we look back on this time as the moment where you took a stand and changed the world?

Time will tell. You will be tested by the challenges of this new century, and at times you will fail. But know that you have it within your power to try. That generations who have come before you faced these same fears and uncertainties in their own time. And that if we're willing to shoulder each other's burdens, to take great risks, and to persevere through trial, America will continue on its magnificent journey towards that distant horizon, and a better day.

Thank you so much to the class of 2006, congratulations on your graduation.`

    fullText: `Good morning to the Class of 2018, the faculty, the parents, the grandparents, fellow honorees, and the paid laughers I have scattered throughout the audience.

It is an honor to join you this morning for this special occasion. It is also an honor to speak to you today from behind this gigantic tree stump. Like some sort of female Lorax with an advanced degree.

Before I get any further, I should actually probably clarify who I am for the parents and grandparents in the audience who are thinking to themselves, "Who is this loud Indian woman? Is that the girl from Quantico? She looks so much worse in person."

No, no, I'm not Priyanka Chopra, not even Padma Lakshmi. I'm the other Indian woman we have allowed to be on television, Mindy Kaling.

You may remember me from my role on The Office as Kelly Kapoor, who internet commenters said was "shrill" and "took up valuable time that could have gone to Steve Carell."

I then created and starred in my own TV show, The Mindy Project. It was an uphill battle to get the show on the air, but it was worth it, because it enabled me to become Dartmouth's most successful female minority show creator who has spoken at commencement!

Oh wait, no. Shonda Rhimes went here. Yup, and she's created like 10 more shows than me, so great.

But today is not about famous alumni. It's about the men and women who have toiled in obscurity for years so that they might better our country. I speak, of course, of the 51 percent of Dartmouth grads who will go into finance—highest in the Ivy League!

I know that going into the real world sounds scary, but it's exciting too. Finally, you'll be in control of your own lives. No longer will there be an irrational Board of Trustees telling you you can't have hard liquor on campus, for the ridiculous reason that they don't want you to die.

It's a real moment of reflection for me to be standing here speaking to all of you now, because it makes me harken back to my own time at my Dartmouth graduation. Madeleine Albright was my commencement speaker; and while I don't remember any specific quotes she said, or even a general gist of what she was talking about, I do remember thinking: "I wonder what it will be like to have my own cell phone?"

I bet none of you remember a time before the internet. Meanwhile, when I was in college we didn't even have Google. If you wanted to find out, say, how tall Ben Affleck was, you were out of luck. You just had to sit there, not knowing, and your entire day would be ruined.

Now we're reaching the part of the speech where I am supposed to tell you something uplifting like "follow your dreams."

In general, advice isn't actually an effective way to change your life. If all it took to make your life great was hearing amazing advice, then everyone who watched TED Talks would be a millionaire.

So don't trust any one story of how to become successful. So here is some practical advice that you may or may not remember at the end of this speech:

First off, remove "Proficient at Word" from your resume. That is ridiculous. You're really scraping the bottom of the barrel of competency there.

Most of your post-college life is simply filling out forms. Car insurance, health insurance, W-2s. W-4s, 1099s. Guess what? None of us know what any of those forms mean, but you will fill out a hundred of them before you die.

You never need more than one pancake. Trust me on this. Cartoons have trained us to want a giant stack of those bad boys, but order one first and then just see how you feel later.

This one is just for guys: When you go on dates, act as if every woman you're talking to is a reporter for an online publication that you are scared of. Date like everyone's watching, because we are.

And this might be the most important—buy a toilet plunger. Trust me on this. Don't wait until you need a plunger to buy a plunger.

Okay, now let's get real. Next year, the next year of your life is going to be bad. You have been in the comfortable fleece-lined womb of mother Dartmouth for four years now, and you're gonna go out in the cold, hard world.

You're graduating into a world where it seems like everything is falling apart. Trust in institutions are at a record low; the truth doesn't seem to matter anymore.

So, Class of 2018, you are entering a world that we have toppled like a Jenga tower, and we are relying on you to rebuild it.

But how can you do that with the knowledge that things are so unstable out there? I'll tell you my secret, the one thing that has kept me going through the years, my superpower: delusion.

My point is, you have to have insane confidence in yourself, even if it's not real. You need to be your own cheerleader now, because there isn't a room full of people waiting with pom-poms to tell you, "You did it! We've been waiting all this time for you to succeed!"

So, I'm giving you permission to root for yourself. And while you're at it, root for those around you, too. It took me a long time to realize that success isn't a zero-sum game.

I thought I might take a second to speak to the ladies in the audience. Hey girls, we need to do a better job of supporting each other. I know that I am guilty of it too. We live in a world where it seems like there's only room for one of us at the table. So when another woman shows up, we think, "Oh my god, she's going to take the one woman spot! That was supposed to be mine!"

But that's just what certain people want us to do! Wouldn't it be better if we worked together to dismantle a system that makes us feel like there's limited room for us? Because when women work together, we can accomplish anything.

Now I wanted to share a little bit about me, Mindy Kaling, the Dartmouth student. When I came to Hanover in the fall of 1997, I was, as many of you were: driven, bright, ambitious.

I arrived here as a 17-year-old, took the lay of the land, and immediately began making a checklist of everything I wanted to accomplish. And I completed that checklist.

Then, I graduated. And I made a new checklist for my twenties: get married by 27, have kids at 30, win an Oscar, be the star of my own TV show, and do it all while being a size 2.

Well, spoiler alert: I've only done one of those things, and I'm not sure I will ever do the others. And that is a really scary feeling. Knowing how far that I've strayed from the person that I was hoping to be when I was 21.

I will tell you a personal story. After my daughter was born in December, I remember bringing her home and being in my house with her for the first time and thinking, "According to movies and TV, this is traditionally the time when my mother and spouse are supposed to be here, sharing this experience with me." And I looked around, and I had neither. And for a moment, it was kind of scary. Like, "Can I do this by myself?"

But then, that feeling went away, because the reality is, I'm not doing it by myself. I'm surrounded by family and friends who love and support me. And the joy I feel from being with my daughter Katherine eclipses anything from any crazy checklist.

So I just want to tell you guys, don't be scared if you don't do things in the right order, or if you don't do some things at all. I didn't think I'd have a child before I got married, but hey, it turned out that way, and I wouldn't change a thing.

So if I could impart any advice, it's this: If you have a checklist, good for you. Structured ambition can sometimes be motivating. But also, feel free to let it go.

I was not someone who should have the life I have now, and yet I do. I was sitting in the chair you are literally sitting in right now and I just whispered, "Why not me?" And I kept whispering it for seventeen years; and here I am, someone that this school deemed worthy enough to speak to you at your Commencement.

Don't let anyone tell you that you can't do something, but especially not yourself. Go conquer the world. Just remember this: Why not you? You made it this far.

Thank you very much, and congratulations to the Class of 2018.`

    ],
    fullText: `I never really expected to find myself giving advice to people graduating from an establishment of higher education. I never graduated from any such establishment. I never even started at one. I escaped from school as soon as I could, when the prospect of four more years of enforced learning before I'd become the writer I wanted to be was stifling.

I got out into the world, I wrote, and I became a better writer the more I wrote, and I wrote some more, and nobody ever seemed to mind that I was making it up as I went along, they just read what I wrote and they paid for it, or they didn't, and often they commissioned me to write something else for them.

Looking back, I've had a remarkable ride. I'm not sure I can call it a career, because a career implies that I had some kind of career plan, and I never did. The nearest thing I had was a list I made when I was 15 of everything I wanted to do: to write an adult novel, a children's book, a comic, a movie, record an audiobook, write an episode of Doctor Who… and so on. I didn't have a career. I just did the next thing on the list.

So I thought I'd tell you everything I wish I'd known starting out, and a few things that, looking back on it, I suppose that I did know. And that I would also give you the best piece of advice I'd ever got, which I completely failed to follow.

First of all: When you start out on a career in the arts you have no idea what you are doing.

This is great. People who know what they are doing know the rules, and know what is possible and impossible. You do not. And you should not. The rules on what is possible and impossible in the arts were made by people who had not tested the bounds of the possible by going beyond them. And you can.

If you don't know it's impossible it's easier to do. And because nobody's done it before, they haven't made up rules to stop anyone doing that again, yet.

Secondly, If you have an idea of what you want to make, what you were put here to do, then just go and do that.

And that's much harder than it sounds and, sometimes in the end, so much easier than you might imagine. Because normally, there are things you have to do before you can get to the place you want to be. I wanted to write comics and novels and stories and films, so I became a journalist, because journalists are allowed to ask questions, and to simply go and find out how the world works, and besides, to do those things I needed to write and to write well, and I was being paid to learn how to write economically, crisply, sometimes under adverse conditions, and on time.

Something that worked for me was imagining that where I wanted to be – an author, primarily of fiction, making good books, making good comics and supporting myself through my words – was a mountain. A distant mountain. My goal.

And I knew that as long as I kept walking towards the mountain I would be all right. And when I truly was not sure what to do, I could stop, and think about whether it was taking me towards or away from the mountain.

Thirdly, When you start off, you have to deal with the problems of failure. You need to be thickskinned, to learn that not every project will survive. A freelance life, a life in the arts, is sometimes like putting messages in bottles, on a desert island, and hoping that someone will find one of your bottles and open it and read it, and put something in a bottle that will wash its way back to you: appreciation, or a commission, or money, or love. And you have to accept that you may put out a hundred things for every bottle that winds up coming back.

The problems of failure are problems of discouragement, of hopelessness, of hunger. You want everything to happen and you want it now, and things go wrong.

And I shrugged, and I still had my electric typewriter and enough money to pay the rent for a couple of months, and I decided that I would do my best in future not to write books just for the money. If you didn't get the money, then you didn't have anything. If I did work I was proud of, and I didn't get the money, at least I'd have the work.

Every now and again, I forget that rule, and whenever I do, the universe kicks me hard and reminds me. I don't know that it's an issue for anybody but me, but it's true that nothing I did where the only reason for doing it was the money was ever worth it, except as bitter experience. Usually I didn't wind up getting the money, either. The things I did because I was excited, and wanted to see them exist in reality have never let me down, and I've never regretted the time I spent on any of them.

The problems of failure are hard.

The problems of success can be harder, because nobody warns you about them.

The first problem of any kind of even limited success is the unshakable conviction that you are getting away with something, and that any moment now they will discover you. It's Imposter Syndrome, something my wife Amanda christened the Fraud Police.

Fourthly, I hope you'll make mistakes. If you're making mistakes, it means you're out there doing something. And the mistakes in themselves can be useful. I once misspelled Caroline, in a letter, transposing the A and the O, and I thought, "Coraline looks like a real name…"

And remember that whatever discipline you are in, whether you are a musician or a photographer, a fine artist or a cartoonist, a writer, a dancer, a designer, whatever you do you have one thing that's unique. You have the ability to make art.

And for me, and for so many of the people I have known, that's been a lifesaver. The ultimate lifesaver. It gets you through good times and it gets you through the other ones.

Life is sometimes hard. Things go wrong, in life and in love and in business and in friendship and in health and in all the other ways that life can go wrong. And when things get tough, this is what you should do.

Make good art.

I'm serious. Husband runs off with a politician? Make good art. Leg crushed and then eaten by mutated boa constrictor? Make good art. IRS on your trail? Make good art. Cat exploded? Make good art. Somebody on the Internet thinks what you do is stupid or evil or it's all been done before? Make good art. Probably things will work out somehow, and eventually time will take the sting away, but that doesn't matter. Do what only you do best. Make good art.

Make it on the good days too.

And Fifthly, while you are at it, make your art. Do the stuff that only you can do.

The urge, starting out, is to copy. And that's not a bad thing. Most of us only find our own voices after we've sounded like a lot of other people. But the one thing that you have that nobody else has is you. Your voice, your mind, your story, your vision. So write and draw and build and play and dance and live as only you can.

The moment that you feel that, just possibly, you're walking down the street naked, exposing too much of your heart and your mind and what exists on the inside, showing too much of yourself. That's the moment you may be starting to get it right.

The things I've done that worked the best were the things I was the least certain about, the stories where I was sure they would either work, or more likely be the kinds of embarrassing failures people would gather together and talk about until the end of time. They always had that in common: looking back at them, people explain why they were inevitable successes. While I was doing them, I had no idea.

I still don't. And where would be the fun in making something you knew was going to work?

Sixthly. I will pass on some secret freelancer knowledge. Secret knowledge is always good. And it is useful for anyone who ever plans to create art for other people, to enter a freelance world of any kind.

People get hired because, somehow, they get hired. People keep working, in a freelance world, and more and more of today's world is freelance, because their work is good, and because they are easy to get along with, and because they deliver the work on time. And you don't even need all three. Two out of three is fine. People will tolerate how unpleasant you are if your work is good and you deliver it on time. They'll forgive the lateness of the work if it's good, and if they like you. And you don't have to be as good as the others if you're on time and it's always a pleasure to hear from you.

When I agreed to give this address, I started trying to think what the best advice I'd been given over the years was.

And it came from Stephen King twenty years ago, at the height of the success of Sandman. I was writing a comic that people loved and were taking seriously. King had liked Sandman and my novel with Terry Pratchett, Good Omens, and he saw the madness, the long signing lines, all that, and his advice was this:

"This is really great. You should enjoy it."

And I didn't. Best advice I got that I ignored. Instead I worried about it. I worried about the next deadline, the next idea, the next story. There wasn't a moment for the next fourteen or fifteen years that I wasn't writing something in my head, or wondering about it. And I didn't stop and look around and go, this is really fun. I wish I'd enjoyed it more.

That was the hardest lesson for me, I think: to let go and enjoy the ride, because the ride takes you to some remarkable and unexpected places.

To all today's graduates: I wish you luck. Luck is useful. Often you will discover that the harder you work, and the more wisely you work, the luckier you get. But there is luck, and it helps.

We're in a transitional world right now, if you're in any kind of artistic field, because the nature of distribution is changing, the models by which creators got their work out into the world, and got to keep a roof over their heads and buy sandwiches while they did that, are all changing.

Which is, on the one hand, intimidating, and on the other, immensely liberating. The rules, the assumptions, the now-we're supposed to's of how you get your work seen, and what you do then, are breaking down. The gatekeepers are leaving their gates. You can be as creative as you need to be to get your work seen.

So make up your own rules.

Someone asked me recently how to do something she thought was going to be difficult, in this case recording an audio book, and I suggested she pretend that she was someone who could do it. Not pretend to do it, but pretend she was someone who could.

So be wise, because the world needs more wisdom, and if you cannot be wise, pretend to be someone who is wise, and then just behave like they would.

And now go, and make interesting mistakes, make amazing mistakes, make glorious and fantastic mistakes. Break rules. Leave the world more interesting for your being here. Make good art.`

    fullText: `Thank you for that warm introduction. It's an honor to be here with you today at this historic institution, speaking to the graduating class of 2017.

When I look out at all of you, I see the future. I see leaders, innovators, change-makers. But more importantly, I see individuals who have the power to be different, to stand out, and to make a lasting impact on this world.

Let me start by telling you a little about my journey. I grew up in a housing project on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. My mother was a single parent who cleaned offices and ironed shirts to make ends meet. We didn't have much, but what we had was determination, grit, and the belief that education could change everything.

I was different from day one. I was loud when I was supposed to be quiet. I asked questions when I was supposed to just listen. I challenged the status quo when I was supposed to accept it. And you know what? That difference became my superpower.

When I started at Xerox as a summer intern in 1980, I was one of the few African American women in the building. I could have tried to blend in, to make myself smaller, to not rock the boat. Instead, I chose to be authentically me. I spoke up in meetings. I challenged processes that didn't make sense. I took on assignments that others thought were too risky.

Some people told me to tone it down. They said I was too direct, too aggressive, too different. But I learned something important early on: the very things that make you different are often the things that make you valuable.

Throughout my career, I've seen too many talented people dim their light because they were afraid of standing out. They were afraid of being the only one in the room who looked like them, thought like them, or had their background. But here's what I want you to understand: diversity isn't just about fairness – it's about excellence.

When I became CEO of Xerox in 2009, I became the first African American woman to lead a Fortune 500 company. That wasn't just a personal milestone – it was a statement about what's possible when we embrace difference instead of fearing it.

But being different isn't always easy. There will be times when you walk into rooms where you're the only one who looks like you. There will be moments when people question whether you belong. There will be days when you doubt yourself.

In those moments, I want you to remember this: you weren't meant to fit in. You were meant to stand out. You were meant to bring something to the table that no one else can bring. Your perspective, your experience, your unique way of seeing the world – that's not a liability, it's an asset.

I've learned that leadership isn't about having all the answers. It's about asking the right questions. It's about being willing to make tough decisions, even when they're unpopular. It's about surrounding yourself with people who complement your strengths and challenge your thinking.

But most importantly, leadership is about authenticity. You cannot lead effectively if you're trying to be someone you're not. People can sense authenticity from a mile away, and they can sense its absence just as easily.

So as you leave this institution and enter the next phase of your lives, I want to challenge you with three things:

First, dare to be different. Don't try to fit into someone else's mold. The world doesn't need another copy of someone else. It needs the original you. Embrace what makes you unique, and use it as your competitive advantage.

Second, take risks. The biggest risk is not taking any risks at all. Throughout my career, I've taken on roles that others thought were too challenging, too risky, or too ambitious. But those risks led to the greatest rewards. Don't let fear of failure keep you from pursuing your dreams.

Third, lift others as you climb. Success isn't just about what you achieve for yourself. It's about opening doors for others who will come after you. Be the leader who creates opportunities for others to be different, to stand out, to succeed.

I want to share something with you that my mother told me when I was young. She said, "Ursula, you have two choices in life. You can be a victim of your circumstances, or you can be the architect of your future." I chose to be the architect, and I want each of you to make that same choice.

The world is changing rapidly. Technology is transforming how we work, how we communicate, how we live. In this environment, the ability to adapt, to think differently, to bring fresh perspectives – these aren't just nice-to-have qualities. They're essential.

You are graduating at a time when the world needs your energy, your ideas, your different way of seeing things. Don't waste that opportunity by trying to be like everyone else.

I'll leave you with this thought: Throughout history, every major breakthrough, every significant change, every leap forward has come from someone who dared to be different. Someone who was willing to challenge conventional thinking. Someone who refused to accept that "this is just how things are done."

You have that same power. You have the ability to look at problems differently, to find solutions that others miss, to create change where others see only obstacles.

So go out there and be different. Be bold. Be authentic. Be the leader the world needs you to be. And remember, your difference isn't something to overcome – it's something to celebrate and leverage.

The future belongs to those who dare to be different. Make sure you're one of them.

Congratulations, Class of 2017. Now go out there and change the world.

Thank you.`

    fullText: `President Frederick, distinguished faculty, proud families, and most importantly, the graduating class of 2016 – congratulations on this remarkable achievement.

It is a profound honor to stand before you today at this historic institution, a place that has been a beacon of excellence and opportunity for generations of African American leaders. Howard University has always been more than just a university – it has been a launching pad for change-makers, innovators, and leaders who have shaped our nation and our world.

As I look out at all of you today, I see the future of leadership in America. But I also see young people entering a world that is changing at an unprecedented pace. The question is not whether change will come – it's how you will lead through that change.

Let me share with you some lessons I've learned about leadership during my time as CEO of American Express, lessons that I believe will serve you well as you embark on your own leadership journeys.

First, leadership is not about being popular. It's about making the tough decisions and doing what's right, even when it's difficult, even when it's unpopular, even when it costs you something personally.

Throughout my career, I've had to make decisions that weren't popular with employees, with shareholders, with the media, or even with my own family. But leadership isn't a popularity contest. It's about having the courage to do what you believe is right for the long-term success of your organization and the people you serve.

When the financial crisis hit in 2008, we had to make some incredibly difficult decisions at American Express. We had to cut costs, reduce our workforce, and fundamentally change how we operated. These weren't popular decisions, but they were necessary decisions. And because we made them quickly and decisively, we emerged from the crisis stronger than ever.

Second, embrace change as an opportunity, not a threat. The world is changing faster today than at any point in human history. Technology is transforming every industry. Globalization is creating new markets and new competition. Social movements are reshaping how we think about equality and justice.

You can either be overwhelmed by this change, or you can see it as the greatest opportunity of your lifetime. I choose to see it as an opportunity, and I encourage you to do the same.

At American Express, we've had to completely reimagine our business model multiple times during my tenure. We've gone from being primarily a charge card company to being a global payments and travel company. We've embraced digital technology, mobile payments, and data analytics. We've expanded into new markets and new customer segments.

Each of these changes was challenging, but each one also opened up new possibilities for growth and innovation. The companies and leaders who thrive in the 21st century will be those who can adapt quickly and turn change into competitive advantage.

Third, character matters more than charisma. In our celebrity-obsessed culture, we often confuse leadership with charisma. We think leaders need to be the loudest voice in the room, the most charming personality, the most telegenic presence.

But true leadership is about character – about integrity, honesty, humility, and moral courage. It's about doing the right thing when no one is watching. It's about keeping your word even when it's inconvenient. It's about admitting when you're wrong and learning from your mistakes.

I've worked with many charismatic people who were terrible leaders, and I've worked with many quiet, humble people who were extraordinary leaders. Charisma might get you noticed, but character is what earns you respect and trust.

Fourth, diversity is not just the right thing to do – it's the smart thing to do. As leaders, you will be responsible for bringing together people from different backgrounds, different perspectives, different experiences. This diversity isn't just about fairness or political correctness. It's about performance.

Study after study has shown that diverse teams make better decisions, solve problems more creatively, and deliver better results. When you surround yourself with people who think differently than you do, you make better choices.

But diversity only works if you create an environment where different voices can be heard and different perspectives can be valued. As leaders, it's your job to create that environment.

Fifth, build bridges, don't build walls. We live in an increasingly polarized world. People retreat into their own echo chambers, surrounding themselves only with people who agree with them. Social media amplifies our differences and minimizes our common ground.

As leaders, you have a responsibility to build bridges across these divides. You need to be able to work with people who don't look like you, don't think like you, don't vote like you. You need to find common ground and build coalitions around shared values and shared goals.

This doesn't mean compromising your principles. It means being principled enough to work with others who share your commitment to making progress, even if you disagree on some of the details.

Finally, remember that leadership is a privilege, not a right. Every leadership position you hold, every opportunity you're given to make a difference, is a privilege that comes with enormous responsibility.

You have a responsibility to the people you lead, to the organizations you serve, and to the communities you're part of. You have a responsibility to use your platform to make things better, not just for yourself, but for others.

As graduates of Howard University, you carry a special responsibility. You are part of a legacy of leaders who have broken barriers, challenged injustice, and opened doors for others. That legacy doesn't end with your graduation – it continues with what you do next.

The world needs your leadership. It needs your energy, your ideas, your passion for justice and equality. It needs your willingness to take on tough challenges and make difficult decisions.

But most of all, it needs your commitment to doing what's right, even when it's hard, even when it's unpopular, even when it costs you something.

The future belongs to leaders who can navigate change with courage, who can build bridges across differences, who can make tough decisions with integrity, and who can inspire others to be their best selves.

You have all the tools you need to be those leaders. You have the education, the intelligence, the passion, and the character. Now it's time to go out and use them.

The world is waiting for your leadership. Don't keep it waiting too long.

Congratulations again, Class of 2016. Now go out there and lead.

Thank you.`

    fullText: `President Klawe, faculty, families, and graduates of Harvey Mudd College – congratulations on this extraordinary achievement.

It is truly an honor to be here with you today at one of the most prestigious science and engineering institutions in the world. When I look out at all of you, I see the future of innovation, discovery, and human progress.

You know, when I was growing up, people often asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up. And I would say, "I want to be a scientist, a dancer, and an astronaut." And they would look at me like I was crazy. They would say, "You have to pick one. You can't do all of those things."

But I'm here to tell you today that you don't have to pick just one thing. You don't have to fit into someone else's narrow definition of what a scientist looks like, what an engineer does, or what's possible for your life.

I became a doctor, an engineer, a dancer, and yes, an astronaut. I've traveled to space, but I've also danced with the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. I've conducted medical research, but I've also studied art and African studies. I've worked on spacecraft, but I've also worked on sustainable development in Africa.

The point is this: don't let anyone rob you of your imagination, your creativity, or your curiosity. It's your place in the world; it's your life. Go on and do all you can with it.

As graduates of Harvey Mudd, you have been trained in some of the most rigorous scientific and mathematical disciplines in the world. You have the tools to solve complex problems, to innovate, to create technologies that can change the world. But I want to challenge you to think beyond just the technical aspects of your education.

Science and technology are not separate from the rest of human experience. They are deeply connected to art, to culture, to social justice, to the human condition. The best scientists and engineers I know are those who understand these connections and use them to inform their work.

When I was selected to be an astronaut, I wasn't chosen just because of my technical qualifications. I was chosen because I brought a unique perspective – as a woman, as an African American, as someone who had lived and worked in different cultures, as someone who understood that science is not just about formulas and equations, but about improving the human condition.

In space, when I looked down at Earth, I didn't see the political boundaries that divide us. I didn't see the artificial barriers that we create between disciplines, between cultures, between people. I saw one beautiful, interconnected planet that we all share.

That perspective changed me, and I want it to change how you think about your role as scientists and engineers. You are not just problem solvers – you are world changers. You are not just technicians – you are visionaries. You are not just graduates of Harvey Mudd – you are citizens of the world with a responsibility to use your talents to make life better for everyone.

But let me be clear: this won't always be easy. You will face challenges, setbacks, and people who doubt you. I certainly did.

When I applied to be an astronaut, I was told that I didn't fit the profile. When I wanted to study both engineering and African studies, I was told to focus on one or the other. When I talked about the importance of including art and culture in space missions, some people thought I wasn't serious about science.

But I persisted, because I knew that my different perspective was not a weakness – it was a strength. And I want you to remember that when you face similar challenges.

Your diversity – whether it's your gender, your race, your background, your interests, your way of thinking – is not something to overcome. It's something to celebrate and leverage. The world needs your unique perspective.

Science and engineering have historically been dominated by people who look and think a certain way. But the challenges we face today – climate change, disease, poverty, inequality – are too complex to be solved by any one group of people. We need all hands on deck. We need all perspectives at the table.

As you leave Harvey Mudd and enter your careers, I want you to remember three things:

First, stay curious. The moment you stop asking questions, the moment you think you have all the answers, is the moment you stop growing as a scientist and as a human being. The universe is vast and mysterious, and there is always more to learn, more to discover, more to explore.

Second, think big. Don't limit yourself to incremental improvements or safe projects. The world needs breakthrough innovations, paradigm shifts, revolutionary ideas. You have the training and the talent to tackle the biggest challenges facing humanity. Don't waste that potential on small problems.

Third, remember your responsibility to humanity. Science and technology are powerful tools, but they are just tools. What matters is how you use them. Use them to heal, not to harm. Use them to unite, not to divide. Use them to lift up the most vulnerable members of our society, not just to benefit the privileged few.

I want to share with you one of my favorite quotes from the great scientist and humanitarian Albert Einstein: "A human being is a part of the whole called by us universe, a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feeling as something separated from the rest, a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty."

That's what I want for all of you – to widen your circle of compassion, to see beyond the boundaries that others try to impose on you, to use your scientific training not just to understand the universe, but to make it a better place for all of us.

You are graduating at an incredible time in human history. We are on the verge of breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, quantum computing, biotechnology, space exploration, and so many other fields. The next few decades will see changes that will make the last century look slow by comparison.

You have the opportunity to be part of that transformation. You have the opportunity to be the generation that solves climate change, that cures cancer, that takes humanity to Mars, that creates technologies we can't even imagine today.

But remember, as you reach for the stars – literally and figuratively – don't forget to keep your feet grounded in humanity. Don't forget that the ultimate goal of all our scientific endeavors should be to improve life for everyone on this planet.

The stars are calling, and you are ready to answer. Go forth and explore. Go forth and discover. Go forth and change the world.

Congratulations, Class of 2015. The universe is waiting for you.

Thank you.`

    fullText: `President Wagner, members of the Board of Trustees, distinguished faculty, parents, family, and friends, and to the class of 2014, I'm delighted and very pleased to be with you on this important occasion.

Now let me join President Wagner in saying congratulations to each and every one of you who are receiving a degree. Congratulations. This is your day. Enjoy it. Be happy. Just be happy, have a little fun. Smile. You look good. You look beautiful, handsome.

And let me just tell you for a moment, I didn't grow up in a big city like Atlanta. I grew up in rural Alabama, 50 miles from Montgomery outside of a little place called Troy. My father was a sharecropper, but back in 1944 when I was only four years old, my father had saved $300. And with the $300, he bought 110 acres of land. My family still own that land today.

It was many, many years ago, when we would visit the little town of Troy, visit Montgomery, visit Tuskegee, visit Birmingham, I saw those signs that said 'white men, coloured men', 'white women, coloured women,' 'white waiting, coloured waiting.' I would come home and ask my mother, my father, my grandparents, my great-grandparents, 'Why?' And they would say, 'That's the way it is. Don't get in the way, don't get in trouble!'

But one day in 1955, 15 years old in the 10th grade, I heard about Rosa Parks. I heard the words of Martin Luther King Jr on our radio. In 1957, I met Rosa Parks at the age of 17. In 1958 at the age of 18, I met Martin Luther King Jr, and these two individuals inspired me to get in the way, to get in trouble.

So I come here to say to you this morning, on this beautiful campus, with your great education, you must find a way to get in the way. You must find a way to get in trouble. Good trouble. Necessary trouble.

Use your education. You have wonderful teachers, wonderful professors, researchers. Use what you have. Use your learning. Use your tools. To help make our country and make our world a better place where no one would be left out or left behind. You can do it and you must do it. It is your time.

In a few short days, we will commemorate what we call the Mississippi Summer Project, when more than a thousand students from all over America, many from abroad, made a trip to Mississippi to encourage people to register to vote. And on the summer night of June 21st, 1964, three young men that I knew, two whites and one African American, went out to investigate the burning of an African American church that was used for voter registration workshop. These three young men were detained by the sheriff, taken to jail, taken out of jail, turned over to the Klan where they were beaten, shot and killed.

And I tell students today, these three young men didn't die in Vietnam. They didn't die in the Middle East or Eastern Europe. They didn't die in Africa or Central or South America. They died right here in our own country, trying to help all of our citizens become participants in the democratic process.

As young people, you must understand that there are forces that want to take us back to another period, but you must say that we're not going back. We made too much progress and we are going forward.

There may be some setbacks, some delays, some disappointment, but you must never ever give up, or give in. You must keep the faith and keep your eyes on the prize. That is your calling, that is your mission, that is your moral obligation, that is your mandate. Get out there and do it, get in the way!

In the final analysis, we all must learn to live together as brothers and sisters, not just in America, but around the world.

You know, I got arrested a few times during the sixties, 40 times, and all of the charges were dropped and dismissed. But since I've been in Congress and young people ask me, how can you be in Congress, you got arrested so many times. I've been arrested since I've been in Congress, five more times. And I may get arrested again.

The last time I got arrested was trying to say to the Congress, we need to pass comprehensive immigration reform and set people on a path to citizenship. It's the right thing to do.

It doesn't make sense that we live in our country, we live in a society where more than 12 million people are living in the shadow, living in fear. That is not right. That is not fair. And that is not just, and you must get in the way and find a way to make the way out of no way.

When I was growing up outside of Troy, Alabama, I had an aunt by the name of Sineva and my Aunt Sineva lived in what we call a 'shotgun house.' My aunt Sineva didn't have a green manicured lawn, had a simple plain dirt yard. And sometime at night, you could look up through the holes in the ceiling, the holes in the tin roof and count the stars. And when it rained she would get a pail, a bucket or tub and catch the rain water.

From time to time, she would walk out into the woods and cut branches from a Dogwood tree and tie these branches together and make what she called a 'brush broom'. And she would sweep the dirt yard very clean, sometime two and three times a week, but especially on a Friday or Saturday because she wanted that dirt yard to look good during the weekend.

One Saturday afternoon, a group of my brothers and sisters, and a few of my first cousins were out playing in my Aunt Sineva's dirt yard. And an unbelievable storm came up. The wind started blowing. The thunder started rolling. The lightning started flashing and the rain started beating on the tin roof of this old shotgun house. My aunt became terrified. She started crying. She thought this whole house was going to blow away.

When it appeared that one corner of the house was going to blow away, my aunt had us all hold hands and walk to that side, to try to hold the house down with our little bodies. When another corner appeared to be lifting, she had us walk to that side. We were little children walking with the wind, but we never left the house.

I say to you, as you leave here, leave this beautiful campus. The wind may blow. The thunder may roll, the lightning may flash, and the rain may beat on our old house. Call it a house of Emory, call it a house of Georgia or Alabama or New York. Call it a house of Europe. Call it a house of Africa. Call it a house of Asia. Of Central or South America. Call it a house of the Middle East.

We all live in the same house, and it doesn't matter whether we are black or white, Latino, Asian American, or Native American. It doesn't matter if we are straight or gay. We are one people. We are one family. We all live in the same house.

Be bold. Be courageous, stand up, speak up, speak out and find a way to create the beloved community. The beloved world. A world of peace, a world that recognizes the dignity of all humankind. Never become bitter, never become hostile, never hate. Live in peace. We are one, one people and one love.

Thank you very much.`

    fullText: `So it's 2006. My friend Harold Ford calls me. He's running for U.S. Senate in Tennessee, and he says, "Mellody, I desperately need some national press. Do you have any ideas?" So I had an idea. I called a friend who was in New York at one of the most successful media companies in the world, and she said, "Why don't we host an editorial board lunch for Harold? You come with him."

Harold and I arrive in New York. We are in our best suits. We look like shiny new pennies. And we get to the receptionist, and we say, "We're here for the lunch." She motions for us to follow her. We walk through a series of corridors, and all of a sudden we find ourselves in a stark room, at which point she looks at us and she says, "Where are your uniforms?"

Just as this happens, my friend rushes in. The blood drains from her face. There are literally no words, right? And I look at her, and I say, "Now, don't you think we need more than one black person in the U.S. Senate?"

Now Harold and I — we still laugh about that story, and in many ways, the moment caught me off guard, but deep, deep down inside, I actually wasn't surprised. And I wasn't surprised because of something my mother taught me about 30 years before. You see, my mother was ruthlessly realistic. I remember one day coming home from a birthday party where I was the only black kid invited, and instead of asking me the normal motherly questions like, "Did you have fun?" or "How was the cake?" my mother looked at me and she said, "How did they treat you?" I was seven. I did not understand. I mean, why would anyone treat me differently? But she knew. And she looked me right in the eye and she said, "They will not always treat you well."

Now, race is one of those topics in America that makes people extraordinarily uncomfortable. You bring it up at a dinner party or in a workplace environment, it is literally the conversational equivalent of touching the third rail. There is shock, followed by a long silence. And even coming here today, I told some friends and colleagues that I planned to talk about race, and they warned me, they told me, don't do it, that there'd be huge risks in me talking about this topic, that people might think I'm a militant black woman and I would ruin my career. And I have to tell you, I actually for a moment was a bit afraid. Then I realized, the first step to solving any problem is to not hide from it, and the first step to any form of action is awareness. And so I decided to actually talk about race. And I decided that if I came here and shared with you some of my experiences, that maybe we could all be a little less anxious and a little more bold in our conversations about race.

Now I know there are people out there who will say that the election of Barack Obama meant that it was the end of racial discrimination for all eternity, right? But I work in the investment business, and we have a saying: The numbers do not lie. And here, there are significant, quantifiable racial disparities that cannot be ignored, in household wealth, household income, job opportunities, healthcare. One example from corporate America: Even though white men make up just 30 percent of the U.S. population, they hold 70 percent of all corporate board seats. Of the Fortune 250, there are only seven CEOs that are minorities, and of the thousands of publicly traded companies today, thousands, only two are chaired by black women, and you're looking at one of them, the same one who, not too long ago, was nearly mistaken for kitchen help. So that is a fact.

Now I have this thought experiment that I play with myself, when I say, imagine if I walked you into a room and it was of a major corporation, like ExxonMobil, and every single person around the boardroom were black, you would think that were weird. But if I walked you into a Fortune 500 company, and everyone around the table is a white male, when will it be that we think that's weird too?

And I know how we got here. You know, there was institutionalized, at one time legalized, discrimination in our country. There's no question about it. But still, as I grapple with this issue, my mother's question hangs in the air for me: How did they treat you?

Now, I do not raise this issue to complain or in any way to elicit any kind of sympathy. I have succeeded in my life beyond my wildest expectations, and I have been treated well by people of all races more often than I have not. I tell the uniform story because it happened. I cite those statistics around corporate board diversity because they are real, and I stand here today talking about this issue of racial discrimination because I believe it threatens to rob another generation of all the opportunities that all of us want for all of our children, no matter what their color or where they come from. And I think it also threatens to hold back businesses.

You see, researchers have coined this term "color blindness" to describe a learned behavior where we pretend that we don't notice race. If you happen to be surrounded by a bunch of people who look like you, that's purely accidental. Now, color blindness, in my view, doesn't mean that there's no racial discrimination, and there's fairness. It doesn't mean that at all. It doesn't ensure it. In my view, color blindness is very dangerous because it means we're ignoring the problem. There was a corporate study that said that, instead of avoiding race, the really smart corporations actually deal with it head on. They actually recognize that embracing diversity means recognizing all races, including the majority one. But I'll be the first one to tell you, this subject matter can be hard, awkward, uncomfortable — but that's kind of the point.

In the spirit of debunking racial stereotypes, the one that black people don't like to swim, I'm going to tell you how much I love to swim. I love to swim so much that as an adult, I swim with a coach. And one day my coach had me do a drill where I had to swim to one end of a 25-meter pool without taking a breath. And every single time I failed, I had to start over. And I failed a lot. By the end, I got it, but when I got out of the pool, I was exasperated and tired and annoyed, and I said, "Why are we doing breath-holding exercises?" And my coach looked me at me, and he said, "Mellody, that was not a breath-holding exercise. That drill was to make you comfortable being uncomfortable, because that's how most of us spend our days." If we can learn to deal with our discomfort, and just relax into it, we'll have a better life.

So I think it's time for us to be comfortable with the uncomfortable conversation about race: black, white, Asian, Hispanic, male, female, all of us, if we truly believe in equal rights and equal opportunity in America, I think we have to have real conversations about this issue. We cannot afford to be color blind. We have to be color brave. We have to be willing, as teachers and parents and entrepreneurs and scientists, we have to be willing to have proactive conversations about race with honesty and understanding and courage, not because it's the right thing to do, but because it's the smart thing to do, because our businesses and our products and our science, our research, all of that will be better with greater diversity.

Now, my favorite example of color bravery is a guy named John Skipper. He runs ESPN. He's a North Carolina native, quintessential Southern gentleman, white. He joined ESPN, which already had a culture of inclusion and diversity, but he took it up a notch. He demanded that every open position have a diverse slate of candidates. Now he says the senior people in the beginning bristled, and they would come to him and say, "Do you want me to hire the minority, or do you want me to hire the best person for the job?" And Skipper says his answers were always the same: "Yes." And by saying yes to diversity, I honestly believe that ESPN is the most valuable cable franchise in the world. I think that's a part of the secret sauce.

Now I can tell you, in my own industry, at Ariel Investments, we actually view our diversity as a competitive advantage, and that advantage can extend way beyond business. There's a guy named Scott Page at the University of Michigan. He is the first person to develop a mathematical calculation for diversity. He says, if you're trying to solve a really hard problem, really hard, that you should have a diverse group of people, including those with diverse intellects. The example that he gives is the smallpox epidemic. When it was ravaging Europe, they brought together all these scientists, and they were stumped. And the beginnings of the cure to the disease came from the most unlikely source, a dairy farmer who noticed that the milkmaids were not getting smallpox. And the smallpox vaccination is bovine-based because of that dairy farmer.

Now I'm sure you're sitting here and you're saying, I don't run a cable company, I don't run an investment firm, I am not a dairy farmer. What can I do? And I'm telling you, you can be color brave. If you're part of a hiring process or an admissions process, you can be color brave. If you are trying to solve a really hard problem, you can speak up and be color brave. Now I know people will say, but that doesn't add up to a lot, but I'm actually asking you to do something really simple: observe your environment, at work, at school, at home. I'm asking you to look at the people around you purposefully and intentionally. Invite people into your life who don't look like you, don't think like you, don't act like you, don't come from where you come from, and you might find that they will challenge your assumptions and make you grow as a person. You might get powerful new insights from these individuals, or, like my husband, who happens to be white, you might learn that black people, men, women, children, we use body lotion every single day.

Now, I also think that this is very important so that the next generation really understands that this progress will help them, because they're expecting us to be great role models.

Now, I told you, my mother, she was ruthlessly realistic. She was an unbelievable role model. She was the kind of person who got to be the way she was because she was a single mom with six kids in Chicago. She was in the real estate business, where she worked extraordinarily hard but oftentimes had a hard time making ends meet. And that meant sometimes we got our phone disconnected, or our lights turned off, or we got evicted. When we got evicted, sometimes we lived in these small apartments that she owned, sometimes in only one or two rooms, because they weren't completed, and we would heat our bathwater on hot plates. But she never gave up hope, ever, and she never allowed us to give up hope either. This brutal pragmatism that she had, I mean, I was four and she told me, "Mommy is Santa." She was this brutal pragmatism. She taught me so many lessons, but the most important lesson was that every single day she told me, "Mellody, you can be anything." And because of those words, I would wake up at the crack of dawn, and because of those words, I would love school more than anything, and because of those words, when I was on a bus going to school, I dreamed the biggest dreams. And it's because of those words that I stand here right now full of passion, asking you to be brave for the kids who are dreaming those dreams today.

You see, I want them to look at a CEO on television and say, "I can be like her," or, "He looks like me." And I want them to know that anything is possible, that they can achieve the highest level that they ever imagined, that they will be welcome in any corporate boardroom, or they can lead any company. You see this idea of being the land of the free and the home of the brave, it's woven into the fabric of America. America, when we have a challenge, we take it head on, we don't shrink away from it. We take a stand. We show courage. So right now, what I'm asking you to do, I'm asking you to show courage. I'm asking you to be bold. As business leaders, I'm asking you not to leave anything on the table. As citizens, I'm asking you not to leave any child behind. I'm asking you not to be color blind, but to be color brave, so that every child knows that their future matters and their dreams are possible.

Thank you.`

    fullText: `President Johnson, distinguished faculty, proud families, and the extraordinary Class of 2020 – congratulations on this momentous achievement.

It is a profound honor to address you today as graduates of Spelman College, an institution that has been a beacon of excellence for Black women for more than 140 years. You are part of a legacy that includes civil rights leaders, scientists, artists, entrepreneurs, and change-makers who have shaped our world.

But today, I want to talk to you about something that I believe is at the heart of the Spelman experience: leadership. Not the kind of leadership that requires a title or a corner office, but the kind of leadership that you can exercise right now, right where you are, with whatever resources you have.

Leadership is not about the title you hold, but about the impact you make. Lead from where you are, with what you have, for the people who need you most.

I learned this lesson the hard way. In 2018, I ran for Governor of Georgia. I had a plan, a vision, and the support of hundreds of thousands of Georgians. But I didn't win. In fact, I experienced what many would call a devastating defeat.

But here's what I learned from that experience: losing a race doesn't mean losing your voice. Failing to win an election doesn't mean failing to make a difference. Sometimes, the most important leadership happens not when you're in the position you wanted, but when you're in the position you find yourself in.

After that election, I could have retreated. I could have felt sorry for myself. I could have given up on the political process altogether. Instead, I decided to lead from where I was. I founded Fair Fight, an organization dedicated to protecting voting rights and ensuring fair elections. I wrote books, gave speeches, and worked to register voters across the country.

And you know what happened? In 2020, Georgia flipped blue for the first time in decades. We helped elect two Democratic senators and played a crucial role in electing a new president. None of that would have happened if I had waited for the "right" position or the "perfect" opportunity to lead.

That's the lesson I want to share with you today: don't wait for permission to lead. Don't wait for someone to give you a title or a platform. Don't wait until you have all the resources you think you need. Lead from where you are, right now.

You might be thinking, "But Stacey, I'm just graduating from college. I don't have any power. I don't have any influence. How can I lead?"

Let me tell you something: some of the most powerful leaders I know are people who started with nothing but a vision and a willingness to work. They didn't wait for someone to hand them a leadership role. They created their own.

Leadership is about seeing a problem and deciding to be part of the solution. It's about using your voice to speak up for those who can't speak for themselves. It's about using your talents to serve others. It's about refusing to accept injustice, inequality, or indifference.

As Spelman women, you have been trained not just to succeed, but to serve. You have been taught not just to achieve, but to lift others as you climb. That's not just a nice sentiment – it's a call to action.

The world you're entering is facing enormous challenges. We're dealing with a global pandemic that has exposed deep inequalities in our society. We're grappling with systemic racism that continues to deny opportunities to millions of Americans. We're facing climate change, economic uncertainty, and threats to our democracy.

These challenges can seem overwhelming. But I want you to see them as opportunities – opportunities to lead, to make a difference, to be part of the solution.

You don't need to solve all of these problems by yourself. But you can choose one issue that matters to you and commit to making a difference. You can use your education, your passion, and your voice to create change.

Maybe you'll become a doctor and work to eliminate health disparities in underserved communities. Maybe you'll become a teacher and help close the achievement gap. Maybe you'll become an entrepreneur and create jobs in communities that need them most. Maybe you'll become an activist and fight for justice and equality.

Whatever path you choose, remember this: your leadership matters. Your voice matters. Your contribution matters.

But leadership isn't just about what you do professionally. It's about how you show up in your community, in your family, in your relationships. It's about being the person who speaks up when others are silent. It's about being the person who stands up when others sit down. It's about being the person who shows up when others turn away.

I want to share with you three principles that have guided my own leadership journey:

First, embrace your authenticity. Don't try to be the leader you think others want you to be. Be the leader you are meant to be. Your unique perspective, your experiences, your background – these are not obstacles to overcome, they are assets to leverage.

As Black women, we often feel pressure to conform, to fit in, to make others comfortable. But the world doesn't need another copy of someone else. It needs the original you. Your authenticity is your superpower.

Second, build bridges, not walls. Leadership is not about defeating your opponents; it's about finding common ground and building coalitions. It's about bringing people together around shared values and shared goals.

This doesn't mean compromising your principles. It means being principled enough to work with others who share your commitment to progress, even if you disagree on some of the details.

Third, turn your setbacks into comebacks. You will face failures, disappointments, and defeats. That's not a sign that you're not meant to lead – it's a sign that you're human. What matters is not whether you fall, but whether you get back up.

Every setback is an opportunity to learn, to grow, to come back stronger. Every defeat is a chance to reassess, to refocus, to recommit to your goals.

I want you to remember that your education at Spelman has prepared you not just for success, but for significance. You have been trained to think critically, to communicate effectively, to solve problems creatively. But most importantly, you have been taught to care – about justice, about equality, about making the world a better place.

That caring is what will drive your leadership. That passion is what will sustain you through the challenges ahead. That commitment is what will enable you to make a lasting impact.

As you leave this institution and enter the next phase of your lives, remember that you carry with you the hopes and dreams of all the women who came before you – the women who fought for the right to vote, the right to an education, the right to be treated with dignity and respect.

You also carry with you the responsibility to open doors for the women who will come after you. Your success is not just about you – it's about all of us.

The world needs your leadership. It needs your energy, your ideas, your passion for justice. It needs your willingness to challenge the status quo and fight for what's right.

Don't wait for someone to give you permission to lead. Don't wait for the perfect opportunity or the ideal circumstances. Lead from where you are, with what you have, starting today.

The future is not something that happens to you – it's something you create. And I have no doubt that you will create a future that is more just, more equitable, and more hopeful than the world you inherited.

Congratulations, Class of 2020. Now go out there and lead.

Thank you.`

    fullText: `Chancellor Block, distinguished faculty, proud families, and the brilliant Class of 2018 – congratulations on this incredible achievement.

It is an honor to be here with you today at UCLA, an institution that has been a launching pad for so many creative minds and innovative thinkers. As I look out at all of you, I see the future of storytelling, the future of media, the future of how we understand and share the human experience.

Today, I want to talk to you about something that I believe is fundamental to who we are as human beings: our stories. Your story matters. Your voice matters. Your perspective is needed. Don't wait for permission to tell your story – create your own opportunities.

When I started my career, I didn't set out to become a filmmaker. I was working in journalism and public relations, and I was good at it. But I felt like something was missing. I felt like the stories I really wanted to tell – stories about people who looked like me, stories about experiences that weren't being represented in mainstream media – those stories weren't being told.

So I made a choice. I decided to stop waiting for someone else to tell those stories and start telling them myself. I took my life savings, bought a camera, and made my first film. It wasn't perfect. It wasn't polished. But it was mine, and it was authentic, and it was necessary.

That film led to another, and another, and eventually to "Selma," "13th," "When They See Us," and "A Wrinkle in Time." But none of that would have happened if I had waited for permission, if I had waited for someone to give me an opportunity, if I had waited for the industry to change.

The lesson I want to share with you today is this: don't wait. Don't wait for the perfect moment, the perfect opportunity, the perfect circumstances. Don't wait for someone to validate your vision or give you permission to pursue your dreams. Create your own opportunities.

In the film industry, I was told for years that stories about Black people, stories about women, stories about social justice – these stories wouldn't sell. They wouldn't find an audience. They weren't commercial. They weren't universal.

But I knew that was wrong. I knew that everyone's story is universal when it's told with truth and authenticity. I knew that representation matters, not just for the people being represented, but for everyone who gets to see and understand different perspectives.

When "Selma" was released, it wasn't just important for Black audiences to see their history reflected on screen. It was important for all audiences to understand that history, to grapple with its implications, to see how it connects to our present moment.

When "13th" explored the intersection of race and mass incarceration, it wasn't just a film for people who already understood these issues. It was a film that opened eyes, changed minds, and sparked conversations that needed to happen.

When "When They See Us" told the story of the Central Park Five, it wasn't just about correcting a historical injustice. It was about showing how the media, the justice system, and society as a whole can fail the most vulnerable among us.

These stories mattered because they were true, because they were necessary, and because they were told with integrity and purpose. But they also mattered because they changed the conversation about what kinds of stories deserve to be told and who deserves to tell them.

That's the power of storytelling. It's not just entertainment. It's not just art. It's a tool for understanding, for empathy, for social change. It's a way to make the invisible visible, to give voice to the voiceless, to challenge assumptions and change hearts and minds.

But here's the thing: that power doesn't belong only to filmmakers or writers or journalists. It belongs to all of you. Every single one of you has a story to tell, a perspective to share, a voice that needs to be heard.

Maybe you're going into business, and your story is about creating companies that prioritize social responsibility and ethical practices. Maybe you're going into medicine, and your story is about providing healthcare to underserved communities. Maybe you're going into education, and your story is about ensuring that every child has access to quality learning opportunities.

Whatever field you enter, whatever career you pursue, you have the opportunity to tell your story through your work, through your choices, through the impact you make on the world.

But telling your story isn't just about your professional life. It's about how you show up in the world every day. It's about the conversations you have, the relationships you build, the communities you serve. It's about being authentic, being honest, being true to your values and your vision.

In a world that often tries to silence certain voices, that tries to marginalize certain perspectives, that tries to make certain people invisible, your commitment to telling your story is an act of resistance. It's an act of courage. It's an act of love.

I want to share with you three principles that have guided my own storytelling journey:

First, authenticity is your superpower. Don't try to tell the stories you think people want to hear. Tell the stories that you need to tell. Tell the stories that come from your heart, your experience, your truth. Those are the stories that will resonate, that will matter, that will make a difference.

Second, representation is revolution. When you tell stories that haven't been told, when you center voices that have been marginalized, when you challenge the dominant narrative, you're not just making art – you're making change. You're expanding the definition of whose stories matter, whose experiences count, whose voices deserve to be heard.

Third, collaboration amplifies impact. Storytelling is not a solo endeavor. The best stories come from bringing together diverse perspectives, different talents, varied experiences. Surround yourself with people who challenge you, who complement your skills, who share your commitment to truth and justice.

As you leave UCLA and enter the next phase of your lives, I want you to remember that you are living in an unprecedented time for storytelling. Technology has democratized the tools of creation and distribution. Social media has given everyone a platform. Streaming services have created new opportunities for diverse content.

But with that opportunity comes responsibility. The stories you tell, the content you create, the messages you share – they have power. They can heal or harm, unite or divide, inspire or discourage. Use that power wisely.

Tell stories that matter. Tell stories that challenge. Tell stories that inspire. Tell stories that bring us together rather than tear us apart. Tell stories that help us understand each other better, that help us see our common humanity, that help us build a more just and equitable world.

Your generation has the opportunity to reshape how stories are told, who gets to tell them, and what impact they have on society. You have the opportunity to create a media landscape that truly reflects the diversity and complexity of human experience.

But that won't happen automatically. It will happen because you make it happen. It will happen because you refuse to accept the status quo. It will happen because you insist on telling your story, even when others try to silence you.

The world needs your stories. It needs your perspective. It needs your voice. It needs your commitment to truth, to justice, to representation, to change.

Don't wait for permission. Don't wait for an invitation. Don't wait for the perfect moment. Start telling your story today. Start with where you are, with what you have, with the platform you can create for yourself.

Your story matters. Your voice matters. Your perspective is needed.

Now go out there and tell it.

Congratulations, Class of 2018. The world is waiting to hear from you.

Thank you.`

    fullText: `President Frederick, distinguished faculty, proud families, and the graduating class of 2017 – it is an extraordinary honor to stand before you today at this sacred institution.

Howard University is not just a school. It is a sanctuary. It is a place where Black minds have been nurtured, Black voices have been amplified, and Black dreams have been realized for more than 150 years. You are part of that legacy, and that legacy is now part of you.

Today, I want to talk to you about something that has shaped my life and my understanding of the world: the power of writing. But I'm not just talking about writing as a craft or a profession. I'm talking about writing as an act of courage, as a tool for truth-telling, as a weapon against ignorance and injustice.

Writing is an act of courage. It requires you to be vulnerable, to tell the truth, and to confront uncomfortable realities. But it's through this courage that we create change.

When I was your age, I was not a good student. I was angry, unfocused, and frankly, I didn't see the point of much of what I was being taught. I dropped out of Howard – yes, this very institution – because I thought I knew better. I thought the world owed me something, and I was impatient to collect.

But life has a way of humbling you, of teaching you lessons you didn't know you needed to learn. And one of the most important lessons I learned was this: education is not just about acquiring knowledge. It's about acquiring the tools to think critically, to question assumptions, to see the world as it really is, not as we wish it were.

It was through writing that I began to understand this. Writing forced me to slow down, to think carefully about what I believed and why I believed it. Writing forced me to confront my own ignorance, my own biases, my own limitations.

But writing also gave me power. It gave me the power to articulate my thoughts, to share my experiences, to contribute to important conversations about race, history, and justice in America.

When I wrote "Between the World and Me," I wasn't trying to write a bestseller or win awards. I was trying to make sense of my own experience as a Black man in America. I was trying to understand how the history of this country had shaped my life and the lives of people who looked like me.

But what I discovered in the process of writing that book was that my personal story was connected to a much larger story – the story of how race has been constructed and used in America, the story of how violence and exploitation have been justified and normalized, the story of how people have resisted and survived and thrived despite it all.

That's the power of writing: it allows us to connect our individual experiences to larger truths, to see patterns and systems that might otherwise remain invisible, to bear witness to realities that others might prefer to ignore.

But writing is not just about individual expression. It's about collective understanding. It's about creating a record, preserving memory, challenging dominant narratives.

For too long, the stories that have been told about Black people in America have been told by others, from the outside, often with little understanding or empathy. But when we tell our own stories, when we write our own narratives, when we insist on our own humanity and complexity, we change the conversation.

This is especially important for you as graduates of Howard University. You have been educated at an institution that has always understood the importance of Black intellectual life, Black scholarship, Black voices. You have been taught not just to consume knowledge, but to create it, to question it, to add to it.

As you leave this place and enter the world, you will encounter people who will try to diminish your intelligence, question your qualifications, dismiss your perspectives. You will encounter systems and structures that were not designed with you in mind, that may actively work against your success.

But you have something powerful: you have your voice, your perspective, your ability to think critically and write clearly about the world as you see it.

Use that power. Write about your experiences. Write about the injustices you see. Write about the beauty you find. Write about the questions that keep you up at night. Write about the solutions you envision.

Don't wait for permission. Don't wait for someone to give you a platform. Create your own platform. Start a blog. Write for your local newspaper. Submit articles to magazines. Apply for fellowships. Pitch book ideas. Use social media to share your thoughts and engage in important conversations.

But remember: with the power to write comes the responsibility to write well, to write truthfully, to write with integrity. Don't just write to confirm what people already believe. Write to challenge, to complicate, to illuminate.

Be willing to be wrong. Be willing to change your mind. Be willing to admit when you don't know something. The best writers are not those who have all the answers, but those who ask the right questions.

And remember that writing is not just about individual success. It's about contributing to a larger project of understanding, of justice, of human flourishing. When you write, you're not just expressing yourself – you're participating in the ongoing conversation about who we are as a society, where we've been, and where we're going.

The world needs your voices now more than ever. We live in an age of information overload, of fake news, of echo chambers and filter bubbles. We need writers who can cut through the noise, who can help us make sense of complexity, who can remind us of our shared humanity.

We need writers who can help us understand how the past shapes the present, how individual experiences connect to larger systems, how we can work together to create a more just and equitable future.

You have been trained for this work. You have been given the tools – intellectual, analytical, creative – to contribute to this vital project. Don't waste those tools. Don't underestimate your own power.

But also remember that writing is hard work. It requires discipline, persistence, and humility. It requires you to read widely, to think deeply, to revise constantly. It requires you to be open to criticism, to learn from failure, to keep going even when the words don't come easily.

Most importantly, it requires you to care – about truth, about justice, about the people whose stories you're telling, about the readers who will encounter your work.

As you leave Howard and begin the next chapter of your lives, I want you to remember that you are part of a tradition of Black intellectual excellence that stretches back generations. You are the inheritors of a legacy of scholarship, activism, and artistic achievement that has changed the world.

But you are not just inheritors – you are creators. You have the opportunity to add your own voices to this tradition, to tell new stories, to ask new questions, to imagine new possibilities.

The pen is in your hands. The page is before you. The world is waiting to hear what you have to say.

Write with courage. Write with conviction. Write with love.

And remember: your words have power. Use them wisely.

Congratulations, Class of 2017. Now go out there and write your way to freedom.

Thank you.`

    fullText: `Dean Gillian Lester, distinguished faculty, proud families, and the graduating class of 2019 – congratulations on this momentous achievement.

It is a profound honor to address you today at Columbia Law School, an institution that has trained generations of lawyers, judges, and advocates who have shaped our legal system and our society. As you prepare to enter the legal profession, I want to talk to you about something that I believe is fundamental to the pursuit of justice: intersectionality.

Justice is not just about individual achievement, but about collective liberation. We must understand how different forms of discrimination intersect and work together to create systemic inequality.

When I first coined the term "intersectionality" more than thirty years ago, I was trying to address a simple but profound problem: the law's failure to see and address the unique discrimination faced by Black women. The courts could see race discrimination. They could see sex discrimination. But they couldn't see what happened when both forms of discrimination came together to create something distinct and particularly harmful.

This wasn't just an academic exercise. This was about real people – Black women who were being denied jobs, who were facing harassment, who were being excluded from opportunities – and who had no legal recourse because their experiences didn't fit neatly into the existing categories of discrimination law.

But intersectionality is about more than just Black women, and it's about more than just race and gender. It's a framework for understanding how all of our identities – our race, our gender, our class, our sexuality, our disability status, our immigration status – interact with systems of power to shape our experiences in the world.

It's about recognizing that people are not just one thing. We are complex, multifaceted beings who exist at the intersection of multiple identities and multiple systems of oppression and privilege.

And here's why this matters for you as future lawyers: the law has tremendous power to either perpetuate inequality or to challenge it. The legal frameworks we create, the cases we bring, the arguments we make – they all have the potential to either see people in their full complexity or to reduce them to single dimensions.

For too long, our legal system has operated from a single-axis framework – looking at discrimination one category at a time, addressing inequality one issue at a time, seeking justice one group at a time. But that approach leaves too many people behind. It leaves behind the people who exist at the intersections, who face multiple forms of discrimination simultaneously, who don't fit neatly into our existing legal categories.

As you enter the legal profession, I want to challenge you to think differently. I want you to develop what I call "intersectional literacy" – the ability to see and understand how different forms of inequality work together, how they reinforce each other, how they create unique harms that require unique solutions.

This means asking different questions. Instead of just asking "Is this race discrimination or sex discrimination?" ask "How do race and gender work together in this situation?" Instead of just asking "How do we protect this particular group?" ask "How do we create systems that protect everyone, especially those who face multiple forms of marginalization?"

This means thinking beyond individual cases to systemic change. Yes, it's important to win individual cases, to get justice for individual clients. But it's also important to think about how those cases fit into larger patterns, how they can be used to challenge broader systems of inequality.

This means building coalitions across difference. Intersectionality is not about dividing people into smaller and smaller groups. It's about understanding how our struggles are connected, how our liberation is bound together, how we can work across our differences to create change.

Let me give you a concrete example. When we talk about police violence, we often focus on the experiences of Black men. And that's important – Black men do face disproportionate levels of police violence, and that's a serious problem that deserves attention.

But if we only focus on Black men, we miss the experiences of Black women who are also victims of police violence – women like Sandra Bland, Breonna Taylor, Atatiana Jefferson. We miss the ways that Black women's experiences of police violence are shaped not just by their race, but also by their gender, by stereotypes about Black women's sexuality and aggression, by the particular ways that Black women are policed and controlled.

The #SayHerName campaign that I helped launch was designed to address this gap, to make visible the experiences of Black women and girls who are victims of police violence. It was an intersectional intervention – an attempt to expand our understanding of police violence to include all of its victims.

But intersectionality is not just about understanding oppression. It's also about understanding privilege, about recognizing how some of us benefit from systems that harm others, about using that privilege responsibly.

Many of you in this room have significant privilege. You're graduating from one of the most prestigious law schools in the country. You'll have opportunities that many people can only dream of. You'll have access to power, to resources, to platforms that can be used to create change.

The question is: how will you use that privilege? Will you use it only to advance your own interests, or will you use it to challenge systems of inequality? Will you use it to climb the ladder and then pull it up behind you, or will you use it to create more ladders for others to climb?

Intersectionality demands that we think about privilege and oppression not as fixed categories, but as dynamic relationships that shift depending on context. You might be privileged in some ways and marginalized in others. You might have power in some situations and be powerless in others.

The key is to be aware of these dynamics, to be thoughtful about how you navigate them, to be intentional about using whatever privilege you have to create more justice, more equality, more opportunity for others.

As lawyers, you will have many opportunities to make these choices. You'll choose which cases to take, which clients to represent, which causes to support. You'll choose how to frame legal arguments, how to tell stories in court, how to use the law as a tool for change.

I encourage you to make those choices with an intersectional lens. Ask yourself: whose voices are being heard? Whose experiences are being centered? Whose stories are being told? And whose voices, experiences, and stories are being left out?

Ask yourself: how can I use my legal training not just to succeed within existing systems, but to challenge and transform those systems? How can I use the law not just to protect the privileged, but to empower the marginalized?

These are not easy questions, and they don't have simple answers. Intersectional thinking requires nuance, complexity, a willingness to sit with ambiguity and contradiction. It requires us to move beyond either/or thinking to both/and thinking.

But I believe that this kind of thinking is essential if we want to create a more just society. We cannot address inequality by looking at one form of discrimination at a time. We cannot achieve justice by focusing on one group at a time. We need approaches that are as complex and multifaceted as the problems we're trying to solve.

The legal profession needs lawyers who can think intersectionally, who can see connections across difference, who can build coalitions for change. The world needs advocates who understand that justice is not a zero-sum game, that liberation for some does not require oppression of others, that we can create systems that work for everyone.

You have the tools, the training, and the opportunity to be those lawyers, those advocates, those change-makers. You have the privilege of a Columbia Law degree, and with that privilege comes responsibility.

Use your legal training to challenge injustice wherever you find it. Use your voice to speak up for those who have been silenced. Use your privilege to create opportunities for others. Use your power to build a more just and equitable world.

The law is not neutral. It is not objective. It is a human creation that reflects human choices, human values, human priorities. And that means it can be changed. It can be improved. It can be made more just.

But that will only happen if people like you – people with legal training, with access to power, with the ability to shape legal discourse – choose to make it happen.

The future of justice depends on your choices. Choose wisely. Choose courageously. Choose with an intersectional lens that sees and values the full complexity of human experience.

Congratulations, Class of 2019. Now go out there and use the law to create the world you want to live in.

Thank you.`

    fullText: `Thank you for this honor. When I first arrived in the robing room I had to figure out who was the president and the chancellor, and they were the ones wearing the most bling. I was invited to give the commencement speech and they said I would have 8 minutes, I said the universe needs more than eight minutes. I need at least nine minutes. Maybe ten.

I thought I would spend this time, brief as it is, together, things that you should know going forward in life. Maybe you already know it, but I don't think everybody knows all of this.

Your grades. Whatever is your GPA rapidly becomes irrelevant in your life. I cannot begin to impress upon you how irrelevant it becomes. Ask anybody just a few years older than you "When was the last time someone asked about your GPA?" And they will have long forgotten, because in life they're not gonna ask you your GPA. They will ask you "are you a hard worker?" "Are you a problem solver?" "Are you committed?" "Are you a good leader?" All of these other questions matter in the rest of your life.

I remember taking the SATs long ago. I remember I got the scores back and my verbal score was ok, but it wasn't one of those scores where a teacher will say "hey he'll go far, watch that student!" So a few years go by, I get my masters, my PHD, I write a column for a magazine... 5 books later I get a letter from the educational testing service in New Jersey. They are the purveyors of the SATs.

I get the letter saying "Gasp, was there an error in my SAT scores?!" I'm a full grown adult reacting this way to a letter. And I open it up and they said "Dear Dr. Tyson, we were reading one of your essays on the universe, and we were impressed with it so much we want to use it for the next round of SATs for the reading comprehension part for the students." So I said "What just happened here!? Something is wrong!"

If the exam means anything, if your GPA means anything, it's that you were in that moment and it so does not define you for the rest of your life.

Another thing- the most dangerous people in a free society are those who don't know- by the way it's ok to not know! This is what school is for! That's ok! But if you don't know, but think you do know, and have power over legislation that would affect others, THAT is dangerous. Those are the signs of the end of an informed democracy.

Science matters. Other subjects matter too, but I'm just saying, science matters in the following way. Think about it. Cavemen and women: they had clean air, freshwater, their food was free range, organic, and their life expectancy was thirty five!

Something else that matters that improves your life expectancy than just the search for clean air and clean water! There's more going on in our lives, brought to you by innovations in science and technology, that improves your health, your wealth, your well-being, just consider that before you start saying "I don't like science, I don't want science" Then move the hell back into the cave and we'll go to your funeral before you turn 36!

Another thing- It's become a past-time to blame politicians for the ills of the world. And I understand the urge to do that, I get that, however, at the end of the day, the politician is a representative of an electorate.

If you have an issue with the politicians that means you have an issue with your fellow citizens that put them there! So if there is a politician that is SURE that the universe is 6,000 years old, It's because there are people walking among us that think that.

As an educator it is my duty to teach people about the methods and tools of science- how and why it works, because the engines of tomorrow's economy depends on it. Innovations in science and technology will drive the 21st century economies. The extent to which you cherry pick science for your own philosophy, just because you didn't like the result- where does it stop! What's gonna happen, you're gonna say "I want to repeal the law of gravity because I gained ten pounds last month!" Where does it stop!

The laws of physics affect us all! Objective truths are true whether or not you believe in them. So if you are not scientifically literate in the 21st century, you will have disenfranchised yourself from important decisions that affect us all. Unless you're ok with that, you should be thinking about how to learn- it doesn't mean you have to be a scientist, no you don't have to be one, just understand what it is, and why!

Scientific literacy is not how much you know, it's how your brain is wired for thought. If someone comes up to you and says "I have these crystals, and if you rub them together and dance under them, it'll cure your ailments." Ok so now, it's easy to be smug and say this person is a freaking idiot, let me just leave them alone.

One might also say "Wow that's great lemme get them, how much are they, I'll buy all of them!" Do you realize each of those states of mind are equally as lazy. It actually takes effort to inquire about the truth of something. Effort. So you ask "Where are these crystals from? What are they made of? What's their chemical composition? What are the properties you're evoking that claims to create the health? What're the experiments, can you cite them?"

That is science literacy. Neither the blunt acceptance or blunt rejection of a claim of someone who is making statements in the name of science.

Another point- this is a personal thing- I think on some level role models are overrated. Let me tell you why.

Growing up in the Bronx- Had I acquired a prerequisite that another black man from the Bronx had become an astrophysicist, I'd still be in the Bronx. If you acquire a role model who looks just like you to be something you wanna be, and you can't find one, is that a reason to not be what you want to be? No!

My argument is simple. You could assemble your role model- get the people that do what you like, but you don't have to be them! Be the piece of them that you want to be, and if it's someone who was moral, do that, someone athletic, do that. You don't have to be the whole person. That protects you from when your person messes up in some fundamental way, there is not this fear that you have to mess up too, because that's what your role model did.

So I encourage people to assemble their role models ala carte. That is a far more potent way to establish what it is you want to become in this world.

Now a couple things just cosmically. The universe is bigger than you are. Lesson one. It sounds obvious, but some people don't really know that. Number two, Earth. If someone invites you to go to Mars, just remember how beautiful Earth is before you do that. You can breathe the air, you know, things like this, however. Do not forget that Earth is really good at killing. Over ninety seven percent of all the species of life on earth that have ever existed are now extinct because of Earth. So we think of Earth as a haven, but in fact it is out to kill us every opportunity it gets. It's our ingenuity in spite of that fact that prevents it.

And the sun, is a limitless source of energy. Oil under the ground, not so much. If you want us to exist and thrive into the future, and you're one of these people that say "I don't need space, I'll solve all my problems here on earth" meanwhile there's unlimited energy, unlimited resources, move back to the cave because that's where you'll be when this is all over.

My final point. We live in a world where not everyone has the urge to help others. Ok? Wanna do it all yourself for yourself, and require that other people help themselves, and I'm reminded of a saying that went around for awhile they say "We need people to lift themselves up by their bootstraps". And then I think about that, and that works you know, sometimes, but we're reminded that it is ok to encourage others to pull themselves up by the bootstraps. But if you do just remember that some people have no boots.

Thank you.`
