    fullText: `Good morning!

I am so happy to be here with you all. I'm proud to be here in the Big Easy. Look at you all! You look good.

Thank you. I want to start by thanking Nicole for that very kind introduction and for sharing her story, which is not too unfamiliar to me -- because they told me I couldn't be where I am, too. So I want to thank Nicole. I'm proud of her. Thank you for the selfie; I think that's the first selfie I've done at a commencement. So, Nicole, you're my first.

And of course, I want to thank the Dillard University Choir. Oh, oh, oh! Oh! That's all I can say. It's like you want to start something up in here, right? It's like, now we got a commencement going on up in here. That was beautiful, beautiful. Thank you so much.

I also want to recognize Senator Mary Landrieu, who is here. Let's give her a hand. She has been a strong supporter of this university.

I want to thank the Dillard University Board of Trustees. I want to thank the faculty, the staff, and, of course, your tremendous president, Dr. Walter Kimbrough. Now, my husband has been called a few things over the years, but he has never had the honor of being referred to as the "Hip Hop President."

I also want to thank all the folks from the University of New Orleans for hosting us here today. And I know they're hosting the folks at Southern University at New Orleans for their commencement later on today as well, so we wish them a wonderful day. And thank you for having us.

And of course, I've got to give a big shout-out to all the family members in the crowd, all of the family members -- especially to the mothers, because it is the day before Mother's Day. To all the mothers, Happy Mother's Day.

Now, graduates, you all handled your business, right? Just because you were graduating didn't mean you -- come on, now. Okay, well, if you didn't, you have my permission to get up and go right now, because there is nothing more important -- no, no, don't get up. Your mothers would kill you if you got up at this moment. So just stay in your seats, and when this is all over make sure you take care of mom.

But in all seriousness, to all the moms out there -- as well as the dads and the grandparents, the uncles, the aunts, the brothers, the sisters, all of you who have helped raise these graduates -- you have seen them through their ups and downs, and you have poured your hearts and souls into these men and women. So today is your day, too, and you should be very proud. You really should.

And finally, most of all, I want to congratulate the beautiful and handsome men and women of the Dillard University Class of 2014. Yay! You all have come so far, I know, to make it to this day -- from all those early days when the girls were sneaking out of Williams Hall to go see the boys over at the Duals -- oh yeah, I did my research -- to all those tests you crammed for, to the plans you're making now for your careers, to go on to graduate school.

You all have seen so much. You've witnessed this school's rebirth after the devastation of Hurricane Katrina -- the new buildings that replaced the ones you lost, the classrooms that started filling back up again, the service projects that you all have done to help this community bounce back. And I know along the way that each of you has written your own story of resilience and determination to make it here to this day.

For example, as you heard, Nicole was told back in high school that she just wasn't college material. But now she is your class president, and she's headed off to Yale for her graduate degree. So there. That's it.

And I know that some of you may come from tough neighborhoods; some of you may have lost your homes during Katrina. Maybe you're like DeShawn Dabney, a graduate who was raised by his grandmother -- maybe -- that's your grandmother, isn't it, DeShawn? Raised by his grandmother while some of his family members were dealing with issues. Maybe just like him, you've been working part-time jobs since you were a teenager to make your dream of going to college come true. And now, today, you're all here ready to walk across this stage and get that diploma.

And no matter what path you took to get here, you all kept your hearts set on this day. You fought through every challenge you encountered, and you earned that degree from this fine university. And in doing so, you are following in the footsteps of all those who came before you, and you have become an indelible part of the history of this school -- a history that, as you all know, stretches back to well before the Civil War, back to 1826, the year a child named Emperor Williams was born.

Now, Emperor was born into slavery. But as he grew up, he managed to teach himself to read and write well enough to create a pass that allowed him to come and go around the city without getting hassled. But one day, his master saw the pass and he said, where did you learn to write like that? Now, just imagine the fear Emperor must have felt when he heard that question -- because remember, back then it was illegal for a slave to learn to read or write. So who knows what kind of punishment he may have gotten -- a beating, a whipping, even worse.

We don't exactly know what happened on that day, but we do know that when Emperor turned 32, after more than three decades in bondage, he became a free man. He decided to stay in New Orleans, and he went on to become a minister -- even founded a church right here in town. And in 1869, when abolitionists, missionaries, black folks and white folks came together to create a school for freed slaves here in New Orleans, Emperor was one of the original signers of the charter.

They decided to name the school New Orleans University, because even though most of the classes would be taught at a high school level or below, oh, their aspirations were much higher than that. And when they laid the cornerstone for that university's first building down on St. Charles Avenue, Emperor got a chance to speak.

He said -- and these are his words -- he said, "For twenty years I was a slave on these streets. It was a penitentiary offense to educate a Negro. I have seen my fellow-servants whipped for trying to learn; but today here am I, speaking where a building is to be erected for the education of the children of my people." He goes on to say, "I wonder if this is the world I was born in."

See, in the course of his short lifetime, Emperor saw education go from being a crime for black folks to being a real possibility for his kids and grandkids. So no wonder he was asking whether this was the same world he'd been born into. See, for a man like Emperor, getting an education could open up a whole new world of opportunity. An education meant having real power. It meant you could manage your own money. It meant you couldn't get swindled out of land or possessions when somebody told you to just sign on the dotted line; sometimes even determined whether or not you could vote.

So most folks back then saw education as the key to real and lasting freedom. That's why, when New Orleans University and the other African American college in town, Straight University, first opened their doors, one of the biggest problems they faced was too many students. That's right -- too many students. Many of these students barely spoke English; they'd grown up speaking Creole or French. Few had ever seen the inside of a classroom or even been taught their ABCs.

But let me tell you, those students were hungry -- you hear me? Hungry. They studied like their lives depended on it. They blazed through their lessons. And that hunger for education lasted for generations in the African American community here in New Orleans.

When an arsonist set fire to the school's library in 1877, they built a new one. When those two original schools ran into financial troubles years later, they started making plans to build an even bigger and better university. And in the 1930s, when white folks complained that this new school would mean too many black students on their buses, the folks at the school got the city to add a bus line just for their students, because nothing -- nothing -- was going to stop them from achieving the vision of those early founders.

And finally, in May of 1934, they broke ground for this school, Dillard University -- a university that would go on to produce some of the leading thinkers and achievers in our country. And the day the cornerstone was laid for your library, the President of Howard University spoke these words: He said, "There lies in this Southland today, buried in unmarked graves, many a black genius who would have blessed this city and this section of our country, if only his parents could have had before them the Dillard University you are now building."

And in the years since then, through segregation and depression, through threats of violence and the floodwaters of a devastating storm, students like you have come here to study and to learn, and to carry forward those hopes and dreams. And today, I stand before a sea of young geniuses. Oh, yeah.

So, graduates, I hope that you understand that this day is not just the culmination of your own dreams, but the realization of the dreams of so many who came before you. And you should be so proud, and so happy, and so excited about your futures. But what you shouldn't be is satisfied. See, because while it is a wonderful thing that all of you are here today, we have to ask ourselves, what about all those geniuses who never get this chance?

I'm talking about the young people from right here in New Orleans and across the country who aren't part of a commencement like this one today, kids no different from all of us, kids who never made it out of high school. The fact is that today, the high school graduation rate for black students is improving, but it is still lower than just about any other group in this country. And while college graduation rates have risen for nearly every other demographic, including African American women, the college graduation rate for African American men has flatlined.

See, and the thing is, when our young people fall behind like that in school, they fall behind in life. Last year, African Americans were more than twice as likely as whites to be unemployed. They were almost three times as likely to live in poverty. And they were far more likely to end up in prison or be the victims of violent crimes.

Now, perhaps when you hear these statistics, you might think to yourself, well, those numbers are terrible, but I'm not part of the problem. And you might be thinking that since you're not one of those statistics, and you're sitting here wearing that nice black robe today, you can go on your way and never look back.

But folks like you and me, we can't afford to think like that -- never. See, because we're the lucky ones, and we can never forget that we didn't get where we are today all on our own. We got here today because of so many people who toiled and sweat and bled and died for us -- people like our parents and grandparents and all those who came before them, people who never dreamed of getting a college education themselves but who worked, and saved, and sacrificed so that we could be here today. We owe them. We owe them.

And the only way to pay back that debt is by making those same kinds of sacrifices and investments for the next generation. And I know sitting here right now, that task could seem a bit overwhelming. I know it could seem like the deck is stacked way too high against our young people. And the truth is that some of the problems we face -- structural inequality, schools that lag behind, workplace and housing discrimination -- those problems are too big for one person to fix on their own.

But that's still no excuse to stand on the sidelines. Because we know that today, education is still the key to real and lasting freedom -- it is still true today. So it is now up to us to cultivate that hunger for education in our own lives and in those around us. And we know that hunger is still out there -- we know it.

We see it in students like DeShawn and Nicole and all of you who scraped and clawed so you could make it to this day. We see it in the single moms who work three jobs so their kids might have a shot at earning a degree like yours. We see that hunger all around the world -- in that young woman named Malala who was shot on her school bus in Pakistan just for speaking out in support of girls getting an education, and the more than 200 girls kidnapped from their own school in Nigeria for wanting an education -- young people who are knowingly risking their lives every day just to go to school.

And in fact, you've seen that hunger right here at Dillard: your valedictorian, three salutatorians are all from Nigeria. They studied hard at an early age, earned scholarships to come here to this university, achieved 4.0 GPAs. And now they are off pursuing master's degrees, work in software development, teaching math and science to young people here in the United States.

See, now, that's the kind of hunger for education that we have to reignite in all of our communities. It's the same hunger that gave life to this university, the same hunger that defined so many of our parents and grandparents -- including my own. You see, my parents never went to college, but they were determined to see me and my brother and all the kids in our neighborhood get a good education.

So my mother volunteered at my school -- helping out every day in the front office, making sure our teachers were doing their jobs, holding their feet to the fire if she thought they were falling short. I'd walk by the office and there she'd be. I'd leave class to go to the bathroom, there she'd be again, roaming the halls, looking in the classrooms. And of course, as a kid, I have to say, that was a bit mortifying, having your mother at school all the time.

But looking back, I have no doubt that my classmates and I got a better education because she was looking over those teachers' shoulders. You see, my mom was not a teacher or a principal or a school board member. But when it came to education, she had that hunger. So she believed that our education was very much her business.

And we need more people who think and act like my mother, and all those mothers out there, because the education of our young people is all of our business. That's what Emperor Williams thought. That's what the folks here in New Orleans thought as they worked to rebuild this campus after Katrina. And as graduates of Dillard University, that's how we need you to think every single day for the rest of your lives.

You all have opportunities and skills and education that so many folks who came before you never could have dreamed of. So just imagine the kind of impact that you're going to make. Imagine how you can inspire those around you to reach higher and complete their own education.

And you can start small. Start by volunteering at an after-school program, or helping some high school kids fill out their college applications. Show them the path that you took. Or you can think a little bigger -- you can get your entire congregation or your community to start a mentoring program; maybe convince your new employer to sponsor scholarships for underprivileged kids. Or maybe you could think a little higher -- maybe you could run for school board or Congress, or, yes, even President of the United States.

And then maybe you could build preschools for every single one of our kids. Maybe you could help turn that pipeline to prison into a highway to college; help give every child in America an education that is truly worth of their promise. Those are the kind of big dreams that folks who founded this university reached for. That is how high they set their bar.

And so we owe it to those folks -- the folks who had the audacity to call their little schools "universities" and name their baby boys "Emperor" -- we owe it to them to reach as high as they did, and to bring others along the way. As the history of this school has taught us, no dream is too big, no vision is too bold; as long as we stay hungry for education and let that hunger be our North Star, there is nothing, graduates, nothing that we cannot achieve.

So, graduates, that is your mission. This is your obligation. I want you to keep reaching higher. I want you all to keep raising your bars. Let the next generation know that there is no greater investment than a good education. And if you do all of this, then I am confident that you will uphold that duty and write your own chapter into the legacy of this great university. And let me tell you something, I cannot wait to see the world that your children will be born into.

Congratulations. I love you all. I am honored to be here. I am proud of you. God bless you. And thank your families.`

    fullText: `Alright, thank you.

So, I've got about apparently I've got about five to six minutes to say the most useful things I can think of.

I'm gonna do my best.

It was suggested that I distill things down to 3 items.

I think I'll go with four.

And I'll try, I think, I think these are pretty important ones.

Some of it may kinda sound like, well you've heard them before.

But, you know, worth reemphasizing.

I think the first is, you need to work, if you, depending on how well you want to do, particularly if you want to start a company, you need to work super hard.

So what is super hard mean?

Well, when my brother and I were starting our first company, instead of getting an apartment, we just rented a small office and we slept on the couch and we showered in the YMCA.

We're so hard up that we had just one computer.

So the website was up during the day, and I was coding at night.

7 days a week, all the time.

And I, sort of briefly had a girlfriend in that period and in order to be with me, she had to sleep in the office.

So, work hard, like, every waking hour.

That's the thing I would say, particularly if you're starting a company.

And I mean, if you do the simple math, you say like somebody else is working 50 hours a week and you're working 100, you'll get twice as done, as much done, in the course of the year as the other company.

The other thing I'd say is that if you're creating a company, or if you're joining a company, the most important thing is to attract great people.

So either be with, join a group that's amazing, that you really respect.

Or, if you're building a company, you've got to gather great people.

I mean, all a company is is a group of people that have gathered together to create a product or service.

So depending upon how talented and hard working that group is, and to the degree in which they are focused cohesively in a good direction, that will determine the success of the company.

So, do everything you can to gather great people, if you're creating a company.

Then, I'd say focus on signal over noise.

A lot of companies get confused.

They spend a lot of money on things that don't actually make the product better.

So, for example, at Tesla, we've never spent any money on advertising.

We've put all the money into R and D and manufacturing and design to try and make the car as good as possible.

And, I think that's the way to go. For any given company, keep thinking about, "Are, these efforts that people are expending, are they resulting in a better product or service?"

And if they're not, stop those efforts.

And then the final thing is, is to sort of, don't just follow the trend.

So, you may have heard me say that it's good to thinking terms of the physics approach, the first principles.

With is, rather than reasoning by analogy, you boil things down to the most fundamental truths you can imagine, and then you reason up from there.

And this is a good way to figure out if something really makes sense, or is it just what everybody else is doing.

It's hard to think that way, you can't think that way about everything.

It takes a lot of effort. But if you're trying to do something new, it's the best way to thing.

And that framework was developed by physicists to figure out counter intuitive things, like quantum mechanics.

It's really a powerful, powerful method.

And anyways, so that's, and then the final thing I would encourage you to do is now is the time to take risks.

You don't have kids, you're obligations, well! Some of you… Hahaha, you probably don't have kids.

But as you get older, your obligations start to increase.

So, and, once you have a family, you start taking risks not just for yourself, but for your family as well.

It gets harder to do things that might not work out. So now is the time to do that.

Before you have those obligations. So I would encourage you to take risks now, and to do something bold.

You won't regret it. Thank you.

I don't know if it was helpful. Great.`

I am honored to be here. I am honored to be here with all of you. I am honored to be here with the class of 2015.

I want to start by telling you something that I wish somebody had told me when I was sitting where you are today. And it is this: You don't have to be grateful for everything.

I know this sounds strange, coming from somebody who has been as fortunate as I have been. But I think gratitude is important, and I think it's important to be grateful for the good things in your life. But I also think it's important to be angry about the bad things. And I think it's important to be angry about injustice.

All over the world, girls are raised to make themselves likeable, to twist themselves into shapes that suit other people. Please do not twist yourself into shapes to please. Don't do it. If someone likes that version of you, that version of you that is false and holds back, then they actually just like that twisted shape, and not you. And the world is such a gloriously multifaceted, diverse place that there are people in the world who will like you, the real you, as you are.

I want to talk to you about being a young woman in the world. And the first thing I want to say is this: Be a full person. A full person is a complicated thing. You can be intelligent and a good cook. You can be a good cook and be not-so-good at math. You can love fashion and love physics. You can be a whole person.

I think we do a great disservice to boys in how we raise them. We stifle the humanity of boys. We define masculinity in a very narrow way. Masculinity is a hard, small cage, and we put boys inside this cage.

We teach boys to be afraid of fear, of weakness, of vulnerability. We teach them to mask their true selves, because they have to be, in Nigerian-speak, a hard man.

But by doing this, we rob them of a full range of human emotions. We rob them of the ability to be vulnerable, which is the birthplace of innovation, of creativity, of change.

The problem with gender is that it prescribes how we should be rather than recognizing how we are. Imagine how much happier we would be, how much freer to be our true individual selves, if we didn't have the weight of gender expectations.

I want to talk about work. I want you to reject the idea of work-life balance. The phrase 'work-life balance' is not only impossible to achieve; it's also a trap. It assumes that work is separate from life, when in fact, work is part of life.

Instead, I want you to think about work-life integration. How can you integrate your work into your life in a way that makes sense for you? How can you make your work meaningful? How can you make your life meaningful?

And please, when you get that first job, and you will, don't spend your time trying to make your boss happy. Spend your time trying to do good work. Good work speaks for itself.

I want to talk about love. Love is not something that you find. Love is something that you create. Love is something that you build. Love is something that you work at every single day.

And when you love, love fully. Love with your whole heart. Love without reservation. But also love with your eyes wide open. Love does not mean that you have to lose yourself.

I want to talk about failure. You will fail. I have failed many times. Failure is not the opposite of success; it's part of success. When you fail, and you will, don't let it define you. Let it teach you.

I want to talk about feminism. I am a feminist. And I think you should be feminists too. Feminism is not about hating men. It's about justice. It's about fairness. It's about giving women the same opportunities that men have.

Some people ask me, 'Why do you call yourself a feminist? Why not just say you believe in human rights?' The reason is that for centuries, women have been excluded from the idea of what it means to be human. Feminism is about including women in the idea of what it means to be human.

I want to end by saying this: You are graduating from one of the finest institutions in the world. You have been given an incredible gift. But with that gift comes responsibility. You have a responsibility to use your education, your privilege, your voice to make the world a better place.

The world needs you. The world needs your ideas, your energy, your passion. The world needs you to be brave, to be bold, to be unapologetically yourselves.

So go out there and create the world you want to live in. Go out there and be the change you want to see. Go out there and be magnificent.

Thank you.`

It's an honor to be here with you today. And I have to say, I'm a little nervous. The last time I spoke at a university commencement, the students gave me a standing ovation. Of course, that was because I told them I was cutting my remarks short.

But seriously, I'm thrilled to be here at one of America's great public universities. UNC has been a beacon of excellence for more than two centuries, and you graduates are carrying on that tradition.

Now, I know that some of you may be wondering: What's a guy from New York doing here in Chapel Hill? Well, the truth is, I've always had a soft spot for North Carolina. After all, this is the state that gave us Michael Jordan, and as a lifelong basketball fan, I have to respect that.

But I'm really here because I believe in what this university represents: the power of public education to transform lives and communities. And I believe in what you represent: the next generation of leaders who will shape our world.

Now, I want to share with you some lessons I've learned over the years. And the first one is this: Follow your heart, and go with your gut.

When I was your age, I thought I had my life all figured out. I was going to be an engineer, work for a big company, climb the corporate ladder. But life had other plans.

After business school, I took a job on Wall Street. I loved the energy, the competition, the fast pace. But then, in 1981, I got fired. At the time, it felt like the end of the world. But it turned out to be the beginning of something much better.

I used my severance package to start Bloomberg LP. People thought I was crazy. Here I was, competing against established giants like Reuters and Dow Jones. But I believed we could do it better.

And you know what? We did. Today, Bloomberg is a global company with more than 15,000 employees in 192 locations around the world.

The lesson here is simple: Don't be afraid to take risks. Don't be afraid to fail. Some of the best opportunities come disguised as disasters.

The second lesson I want to share is this: Out-hustle the competition.

There's no substitute for hard work. Show up early, stay late, and always be prepared. When I was starting Bloomberg, I worked seven days a week. I slept in the office. I did whatever it took.

Now, I'm not saying you should sacrifice your health or your relationships. But I am saying that if you want to succeed, you have to be willing to work harder than the next person.

And don't be afraid to throw some elbows when necessary. Business is competitive. Politics is competitive. Life is competitive. If you're not willing to fight for what you believe in, someone else will take it from you.

The third lesson is about teamwork. No one succeeds alone. Surround yourself with people who are smarter than you, who challenge you, who make you better.

At Bloomberg, we've always believed that diversity makes us stronger. We hire the best people, regardless of their background, their gender, their race, their religion. And that diversity of thought and experience has been one of our greatest competitive advantages.

The fourth lesson is about giving back. Success isn't just about what you achieve for yourself. It's about what you do for others.

I've been fortunate in my life. I've been able to build a successful business, serve as mayor of New York City, and now focus on philanthropy. But none of that would have been possible without the opportunities that others gave me.

That's why I believe so strongly in public education, in public health, in public service. These are the institutions that give everyone a chance to succeed, regardless of where they come from.

And that brings me to my final lesson: Don't make decisions based on money alone.

I know that many of you are graduating with student loans. I know that you're worried about finding a job, paying your bills, starting your careers. Those are legitimate concerns.

But don't let money be the only factor in your decisions. Do what you love. Find a way to get paid for it. And if you ever have the luxury of multiple job offers, don't make the decision based on salary alone.

Choose the job that will teach you the most, that will challenge you the most, that will give you the best foundation for the rest of your career.

Money will come and go. But the skills you learn, the relationships you build, the impact you make – those things will last forever.

So as you leave here today, remember these lessons: Follow your heart. Work hard. Build great teams. Give back. And don't let money be your only guide.

The world needs your energy, your ideas, your passion. The world needs you to solve problems, to create opportunities, to make a difference.

You have the education, the tools, and the talent to do amazing things. Now go out there and do them.

Congratulations, Class of 2012. The future is yours.

Thank you.`

Wow, what an honor to be here today. Thank you, President Nikias. Thank you, Board of Trustees. Faculty, families, and most importantly, graduates of USC Class of 2011!

I have to tell you, I am pumped to be here! This is fantastic! USC! Fight on!

You know, when I was asked to speak here today, I was thrilled. USC has always held a special place in my heart. This is a university that understands passion, that understands excellence, that understands what it means to fight on!

And that's what I want to talk to you about today: passion, ideas, and tenacity. These three things – boom! – bake them in, and they'll really take you a long way.

Let me start with ideas. Great ideas matter. They can change everything. They can change your life, they can change the world.

When I was at Harvard Business School, I had a professor who said something that stuck with me. He said, "The power of an idea is not in its complexity, but in its ability to change how people think and act."

That's what happened with Microsoft. Bill Gates and Paul Allen had an idea: a computer on every desk and in every home. People thought they were crazy. Computers were these massive machines that filled entire rooms. But they had a vision, and they pursued it with passion.

And look what happened. Today, there are billions of computers around the world. That idea changed everything.

But here's the thing about ideas: they're not enough by themselves. You need passion to bring them to life.

Passion is your job to discover. It's not something that just happens to you. You have to go out and find it. You have to try things, experiment, take risks.

I found my passion in technology, in software, in the incredible potential of what we could build. But your passion might be completely different. It might be in medicine, in education, in art, in business, in public service.

The key is to keep looking until you find it. And when you do find it, embrace it with everything you've got.

Because here's what I've learned: when you're passionate about something, work doesn't feel like work. Challenges become opportunities. Obstacles become puzzles to solve.

At Microsoft, we used to have this saying: "We're not just building software, we're changing the world." That passion, that sense of purpose, that's what drove us to work those crazy hours, to push through the difficult times, to never give up.

Which brings me to the third thing: tenacity. Be tenacious. Be irrepressible.

You're going to face setbacks. You're going to face failures. You're going to face people who tell you that your ideas won't work, that you're not good enough, that you should give up.

Don't listen to them. Be tenacious.

When I joined Microsoft in 1980, we were a small company with big dreams. We faced competition from much larger companies. We made mistakes. We had products that failed.

But we never gave up. We kept pushing, kept innovating, kept believing in our vision.

And you know what? That tenacity paid off. Microsoft became one of the most successful companies in the world, and we helped usher in the personal computer revolution.

But tenacity isn't just about business success. It's about life success. It's about not giving up on your dreams, your relationships, your values.

It's about getting back up every time you get knocked down. It's about learning from your failures and using them to become stronger.

Now, I want to talk specifically about USC and why I think this university is so special.

USC has a culture that promotes passion and tenacity. This is a place where people dream big and work hard to achieve those dreams.

Look around you. Look at your classmates. These are people who didn't just coast through college. These are people who got involved, who took risks, who pushed themselves to be better.

That's the USC spirit. That's what "Fight On" really means. It means never giving up. It means always striving for excellence. It means having the courage to pursue your dreams, no matter how big they are.

And that spirit, that culture, that's something you'll carry with you for the rest of your lives.

So as you leave here today, remember these three things: Ideas matter. Find your passion. Be tenacious.

The world needs your ideas. The world needs your passion. The world needs your tenacity.

You're graduating at an incredible time. Technology is advancing at an unprecedented pace. Global challenges require innovative solutions. There are opportunities everywhere for people who are willing to think big and work hard.

Don't be afraid to take risks. Don't be afraid to fail. Don't be afraid to dream big.

You have the education, the skills, and the USC spirit to do amazing things. Now go out there and do them!

Fight on, Class of 2011! Fight on!

Thank you!`

Dean Khurana, faculty, proud parents, and graduates, thank you so much for letting me share this amazing day with you.

As I look out at all of you, I'm reminded of my own graduation day and how excited I was to get started with my life. I'm sure you feel the same way.

Today I want to talk to you about gifts and choices. Cleverness is a gift, kindness is a choice. Gifts are easy -- they're given after all. Choices can be hard.

You can seduce yourself with your gifts if you're not careful, and if you do, it'll probably be to the detriment of your choices.

This is a group with many gifts. I'm sure one of your gifts is the gift of a sharp and creative mind. I'm also sure you have other gifts, and I'm sure you've worked hard to develop them.

When I was 12 years old, I was a garage inventor. I invented an automatic gate closer out of cement-filled tires, a solar cooker that didn't work very well, and a device to entrap my siblings.

Yesterday, as I was preparing this speech, I called my mom to ask her what she remembered about that time. She said what she remembered was that I was always making a mess and never cleaning it up. Fair point.

You know what she didn't say? She didn't say, "Well, you were gifted." She said I was always making a mess. That's not about gifts, that's about choices.

I will hazard a prediction. When you are 80 years old, and in a quiet moment of reflection narrating for only yourself the most personal version of your life story, the telling that will be most compact and meaningful will be the series of choices you have made. In the end, we are our choices.

Build yourself a great story.

Thank you, and congratulations to the class of 2010.

I want to talk about choice. You can choose to be lazy or you can choose to work hard. You can choose to follow your passions or you can choose to follow the safe path.

When I graduated from Princeton in 1986, I had offers from Wall Street firms, and I had this crazy idea about starting something called an online bookstore.

Most people, including my parents, thought I was making a mistake. They said, "You have a good job on Wall Street. Why would you give that up for something that probably won't work?"

But I had what I called a "regret minimization framework." I projected myself forward to age 80 and asked: Will I regret not trying this thing that I'm passionate about?

The answer was clear. I knew I would regret not trying more than I would regret failing.

So I left my job, drove across the country with my wife, and started Amazon in a garage in Bellevue, Washington.

It wasn't easy. For the first few years, I was packing books on my hands and knees on a concrete floor. We couldn't afford desks, so we made them out of doors from Home Depot.

But I was following my passion, and that made all the difference.

Today, Amazon is one of the largest companies in the world. But more importantly, we've been able to create hundreds of thousands of jobs and serve millions of customers.

None of that would have happened if I had chosen the safe path.

So my advice to you is this: Follow your passion. Take risks. Don't be afraid to fail.

But also remember that with great gifts come great responsibilities. You have been given so much. You have brilliant minds, you have access to incredible resources, you have opportunities that most people in the world can only dream of.

What are you going to do with those gifts?

Are you going to use them just for yourself? Or are you going to use them to make the world a better place?

I hope you choose the latter.

The world needs your energy, your passion, your creativity. The world needs you to solve big problems, to create new opportunities, to build a better future.

So as you leave here today, remember: Cleverness is a gift, kindness is a choice. Gifts are easy, choices can be hard.

Choose to be kind. Choose to work hard. Choose to follow your passion. Choose to make a difference.

In the end, we are our choices. Build yourself a great story.

Congratulations, Class of 2010. Thank you.`

    fullText: `Thank you, President Hennessy, and to the trustees and the faculty, to all of the parents and grandparents, to you, the Stanford graduates. Thank you for letting me share this amazing day with you.

I need to begin by letting everyone in on a little secret. The secret is that Kirby Bumpus, Stanford Class of '08, is my goddaughter. So, I was thrilled when President Hennessy asked me to be your Commencement speaker, because this is the first time I've been allowed on campus since Kirby's been here.

You see, Kirby's a very smart girl. She wants people to get to know her on her own terms, she says. Not in terms of who she knows. So, she never wants anyone who's first meeting her to know that I know her and she knows me.

But I also know why my dad was insisting on that diploma, because, as B. B. King put it, "The beautiful thing about learning is that nobody can take that away from you." And learning is really in the broadest sense what I want to talk about today, because your education, of course, isn't ending here. In many ways, it's only just begun.

The world has so many lessons to teach you. I consider the world, this Earth, to be like a school and our life the classrooms. And sometimes here in this Planet Earth school the lessons often come dressed up as detours or roadblocks. And sometimes as full-blown crises. And the secret I've learned to getting ahead is being open to the lessons, lessons from the grandest university of all, that is, the universe itself.

It's being able to walk through life eager and open to self-improvement and that which is going to best help you evolve, 'cause that's really why we're here, to evolve as human beings. To grow into more of ourselves, always moving to the next level of understanding, the next level of compassion and growth.

So, today, I just want to share a few lessons—meaning three—that I've learned in my journey so far. The three lessons that have had the greatest impact on my life have to do with feelings, with failure and with finding happiness.

A year after I left college, I was given the opportunity to co-anchor the 6 o'clock news in Baltimore. So, I was 22 years old, making $22,000 a year. And it's where I met my best friend, Gayle, who was an intern at the same TV station.

So, here I am, 22, making $22,000 a year and, yet, it didn't feel right. The first sign was when they tried to change my name. The news director said to me at the time, "Nobody's going to remember Oprah. So, we want to change your name. We've come up with a name we think that people will remember and people will like. It's a friendly name: Suzie."

But my name wasn't Suzie. So, I thought, no, it doesn't feel right. I'm not going to change my name. And if people remember it or not, that's OK.

And then they said they didn't like the way I looked. So, they sent me to a salon where they gave me a perm, and after a few days all my hair fell out and I had to shave my head. And then they really didn't like the way I looked.

But even worse than being bald, I really hated, hated, hated being sent to report on other people's tragedies as a part of my daily duty, knowing that I was just expected to observe, when everything in my instinct told me that I should be doing something, I should be lending a hand.

And after eight months, I lost that job. They said I was too emotional. I was too much. But since they didn't want to pay out the contract, they put me on a talk show in Baltimore. And the moment I sat down on that show, the moment I did, I felt like I'd come home. I realized that TV could be more than just a playground, but a platform for service, for helping other people lift their lives. And the moment I sat down, doing that talk show, it felt like breathing. It felt right. And that's where everything that followed for me began.

And I got that lesson. When you're doing the work you're meant to do, it feels right and every day is a bonus, regardless of what you're getting paid.

And how do you know when you're doing something right? How do you know that? It feels so. What I know now is that feelings are really your GPS system for life. When you're supposed to do something or not supposed to do something, your emotional guidance system lets you know. The trick is to learn to check your ego at the door and start checking your gut instead. Every right decision I've made—every right decision I've ever made—has come from my gut. And every wrong decision I've ever made was a result of me not listening to the greater voice of myself.

If it doesn't feel right, don't do it. That's the lesson. And that lesson alone will save you, my friends, a lot of grief. Even doubt means don't.

So, I say to you, forget about the fast lane. If you really want to fly, just harness your power to your passion. Honor your calling. Everybody has one. Trust your heart and success will come to you.

So, how do I define success? Let me tell you, money's pretty nice. I'm not going to stand up here and tell you that it's not about money, 'cause money is very nice. I like money. It's good for buying things.

But having a lot of money does not automatically make you a successful person. What you want is money and meaning. You want your work to be meaningful. Because meaning is what brings the real richness to your life. What you really want is to be surrounded by people you trust and treasure and by people who cherish you. That's when you're really rich.

So, lesson one, follow your feelings. If it feels right, move forward. If it doesn't feel right, don't do it.

Now I want to talk a little bit about failings, because nobody's journey is seamless or smooth. We all stumble. We all have setbacks. If things go wrong, you hit a dead end—as you will—it's just life's way of saying time to change course. So, ask every failure—this is what I do with every failure, every crisis, every difficult time—I say, what is this here to teach me? And as soon as you get the lesson, you get to move on. If you really get the lesson, you pass and you don't have to repeat the class.

And what I've found is that difficulties come when you don't pay attention to life's whisper, because life always whispers to you first. And if you ignore the whisper, sooner or later you'll get a scream. Whatever you resist persists. But, if you ask the right question—not why is this happening, but what is this here to teach me?—it puts you in the place and space to get the lesson you need.

Many of you know that I started this school in Africa. And I founded the school, where I'm trying to give South African girls a shot at a future like yours—Stanford. And yet, last fall, I was faced with a crisis I had never anticipated.

And the whole time I kept asking that question: What is this here to teach me? And, as difficult as that experience has been, I got a lot of lessons. I understand now the mistakes I made, because I had been paying attention to all of the wrong things. I'd built that school from the outside in, when what really mattered was the inside out.

So, it's a lesson that applies to all of our lives as a whole. What matters most is what's inside. What matters most is the sense of integrity, of quality and beauty. I got that lesson.

This is what I know for sure: In order to be truly happy, you must live along with and you have to stand for something larger than yourself. Because life is a reciprocal exchange. To move forward you have to give back. And to me, that is the greatest lesson of life. To be happy, you have to give something back.

The lesson here is clear, and that is, if you're hurting, you need to help somebody ease their hurt. If you're in pain, help somebody else's pain. And when you're in a mess, you get yourself out of the mess helping somebody out of theirs. And in the process, you get to become a member of what I call the greatest fellowship of all, the sorority of compassion and the fraternity of service.

So, whatever field you choose, if you operate from the paradigm of service, I know your life will have more value and you will be happy.

So, let me end with one of my favorite quotes from Martin Luther King. Dr. King said, "Not everybody can be famous. But everybody can be great, because greatness is determined by service." He said, "You don't have to have a college degree to serve. You don't have to make your subject and verb agree to serve. You don't have to know about Plato or Aristotle to serve. You don't have to know Einstein's theory of relativity to serve. You only need a heart full of grace and a soul generated by love."

You have the heart and the smarts to go with it. And it's up to you to decide, really, where will you now use those gifts? You've got the diploma, so go out and get the lessons, 'cause I know great things are sure to come.

Congratulations, '08!`

    fullText: `I'm honored to be with you today for your commencement from one of the finest universities in the world. Truth be told, I never graduated from college. And this is the closest I've ever gotten to a college graduation.

Today I want to tell you three stories from my life. That's it. No big deal. Just three stories.

The first story is about connecting the dots. I dropped out of Reed College after the first six months, but then stayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before I really quit. So why'd I drop out?

It started before I was born. My biological mother was a young, unwed graduate student, and she decided to put me up for adoption. She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates, so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife.

Except that when I popped out, they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl. So my parents, who were on a waiting list, got a call in the middle of the night asking, "We've got an unexpected baby boy. Do you want him?" They said, "Of course."

My biological mother found out later that my mother had never graduated from college, and that my father had never graduated from high school. She refused to sign the final adoption papers. She only relented a few months later, when my parents promised that I would go to college.

And 17 years later I did go to college. But I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford. And all of my working class parents' savings were being spent on my college tuition.

After six months, I couldn't see the value in it. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life, and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out. And here I was, spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life.

So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK. It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made.

The minute I dropped out, I could stop taking the required classes that didn't interest me, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked far more interesting.

It wasn't all romantic. I didn't have a dorm room, so I slept on the floor in friends' rooms. I returned Coke bottles for the five-cent deposits to buy food with. And I would walk the seven miles across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna temple. I loved it.

And much of what I stumbled into, by following my curiosity and intuition, turned out to be priceless later on. Let me give you one example.

Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country. Because I had dropped out, and didn't have to take the normal classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this. I learned about serif and sans-serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle, in a way that science can't capture. And I found it fascinating.

None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life. But ten years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful typography. If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts. And since Windows just copied the Mac, it's likely that no personal computer would have them.

If I had never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on that calligraphy class, and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do. Of course, it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college. But it was very, very clear looking backwards, ten years later.

Again, you can't connect the dots looking forward. You can only connect them looking backwards, so you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something: your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. Because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart, even when it leads you off the well-worn path. And that will make all the difference.

My second story is about love and loss. I was lucky. I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents' garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in ten years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4,000 employees.

We just released our finest creation—the Macintosh—a year earlier, and I'd just turned 30. And then I got fired. How can you get fired from a company you started?

Well, as Apple grew, we hired someone—who I thought was very talented—to run the company with me. And for the first year or so, things went well. But then our visions of the future began to diverge. And eventually we had a falling out. When we did, our board of directors sided with him. And so at 30 I was out, and very publicly out.

What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone, and it was devastating. I really didn't know what to do for a few months. I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down, that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me.

I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce, and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly. I was a very public failure, and I even thought about running away from the Valley.

But something slowly began to dawn on me: I still loved what I did. The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit. I'd been rejected, but I was still in love.

And so I decided to start over.

I didn't see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.

During the next five years, I started a company named NeXT, another company named Pixar, and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife. Pixar went on to create the world's first computer-animated feature film, Toy Story, and is now the most successful animation studio in the world.

In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT, and I returned to Apple. And the technology we developed at NeXT is at the heart of Apple's current renaissance. And Laurene and I have a wonderful family together.

I'm pretty sure none of this would have happened if I hadn't been fired from Apple. It was awful-tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it.

Sometimes life's gonna hit you in the head with a brick. Don't lose faith.

I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did. You've got to find what you love—and that is as true for work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.

If you haven't found it yet, keep looking—and don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. And like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking. Don't settle.

My third story is about death. When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like, "If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you'll most certainly be right."

It made an impression on me. And since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself, "If today were the last day of my life, would I wanna do what I am about to do today?" And whenever the answer has been no for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.

Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything, all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure—these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.

Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.

About a year ago, I was diagnosed with cancer. I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning, and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas. I didn't even know what a pancreas was.

The doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable, and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months. My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order, which is doctors' code for "Prepare to die."

It means to try and tell your kids everything you thought you'd have the next ten years to tell them in just a few months. It means to make sure everything is buttoned up so that it will be as easy as possible for your family. It means to say your goodbyes.

I lived with that diagnosis all day. Later that evening I had a biopsy, where they stuck an endoscope down my throat, through my stomach, and into my intestines, put a needle into my pancreas, and got a few cells from the tumor.

I was sedated, but my wife, who was there, told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope, the doctors started crying because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery. I had the surgery, and thankfully I'm fine now.

This was the closest I've been to facing death, and I hope it's the closest I get for a few more decades. Having lived through it, I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when death was a useful but purely intellectual concept.

No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there. And yet, death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because death is very likely the single best invention of life. It's life's change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new.

Right now, the new is you. But someday, not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away. Sorry to be so dramatic, but it's quite true.

Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma, which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice.

And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.

When I was young, there was an amazing publication called The Whole Earth Catalog, which was one of the bibles of my generation. It was created by a fellow named Stewart Brand, not far from here in Menlo Park. And he brought it to life with his poetic touch.

This was in the late sixties, before personal computers and desktop publishing, so it was all made with typewriters, scissors, and Polaroid cameras. It was sort of like Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along. It was idealistic, overflowing with neat tools and great notions.

Stewart and his team put out several issues of The Whole Earth Catalog. And then, when it had run its course, they put out a final issue. It was the mid-1970s, and I was your age.

On the back cover of their final issue was a photograph of an early-morning country road—the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous. Beneath it were the words "Stay hungry. Stay foolish." It was their farewell message as they signed off.

"Stay hungry. Stay foolish." And I have always wished that for myself. And now, as you graduate to begin anew, I wish that for you.

Stay hungry. Stay foolish.

Thank you all very much.`

    fullText: `President Faust, members of the Harvard Corporation and the Board of Overseers, members of the faculty, proud parents, and, above all, graduates.

The first thing I would like to say is 'thank you.' Not only has Harvard given me an extraordinary honour, but the weeks of fear and nausea I have endured at the thought of giving this commencement address have made me lose weight. A win-win situation! Now all I have to do is take deep breaths, squint at the red banners and convince myself that I am at the world's largest Gryffindor reunion.

Delivering a commencement address is a great responsibility; or so I thought until I cast my mind back to my own graduation. The commencement speaker that day was the distinguished British philosopher Baroness Mary Warnock. Reflecting on her speech has helped me enormously in writing this one, because it turns out that I can't remember a single word she said. This liberating discovery enables me to proceed without any fear that I might inadvertently influence you to abandon promising careers in business, the law or politics for the giddy delights of becoming a gay wizard.

Actually, I have wracked my mind and heart for what I ought to say to you today. I have asked myself what I wish I had known at my own graduation, and what important lessons I have learned in the 21 years that have expired between that day and this.

I have come up with two answers. On this wonderful day when we are gathered together to celebrate your academic success, I have decided to talk to you about the benefits of failure. And as you stand on the threshold of what is sometimes called 'real life', I want to extol the crucial importance of imagination.

Looking back at the 21-year-old that I was at graduation, is a slightly uncomfortable experience for the 42-year-old that she has become. Half my lifetime ago, I was striking an uneasy balance between the ambition I had for myself, and what those closest to me expected of me.

I was convinced that the only thing I wanted to do, ever, was to write novels. However, my parents, both of whom came from impoverished backgrounds and neither of whom had been to college, took the view that my overactive imagination was an amusing personal quirk that would never pay a mortgage, or secure a pension.

What I feared most for myself at your age was not poverty, but failure.

At your age, in spite of a distinct lack of motivation at university, where I had spent far too long in the coffee bar writing stories, and far too little time at lectures, I had a knack for passing examinations, and that, for years, had been the measure of success in my life and that of my peers.

However, the fact that you are graduating from Harvard suggests that you are not very well-acquainted with failure. You might be driven by a fear of failure quite as much as a desire for success. Indeed, your conception of failure might not be too far from the average person's idea of success, so high have you already flown.

Ultimately, we all have to decide for ourselves what constitutes failure, but the world is quite eager to give you a set of criteria if you let it. So I think it fair to say that by any conventional measure, a mere seven years after my graduation day, I had failed on an epic scale. An exceptionally short-lived marriage had imploded, and I was jobless, a lone parent, and as poor as it is possible to be in modern Britain, without being homeless.

Now, I am not going to stand here and tell you that failure is fun. That period of my life was a dark one, and I had no idea that there was going to be what the press has since represented as a kind of fairy tale resolution.

So why do I talk about the benefits of failure? Simply because failure meant a stripping away of the inessential. I stopped pretending to myself that I was anything other than what I was, and began to direct all my energy into finishing the only work that mattered to me. Had I really succeeded at anything else, I might never have found the determination to succeed in the one arena I believed I truly belonged. I was set free, because my greatest fear had been realised, and I was still alive, and I still had a daughter whom I adored, and I had an old typewriter and a big idea. And so rock bottom became the solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life.

You might never fail on the scale I did, but some failure in life is inevitable. It is impossible to live without failing at something, unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all – in which case, you fail by default.

Failure gave me an inner security that I had never attained by passing examinations. Failure taught me things about myself that I could have learned no other way. I discovered that I had a strong will, and more discipline than I had suspected; I also found out that I had friends whose value was truly above the price of rubies.

The knowledge that you have emerged wiser and stronger from setbacks means that you are, ever after, secure in your ability to survive. You will never truly know yourself, or the strength of your relationships, until both have been tested by adversity.

Now you might think that I chose my second theme, the importance of imagination, because of the part it played in rebuilding my life, but that is not wholly so. Imagination is not only the uniquely human capacity to envision that which is not, and therefore the fount of all invention and innovation. In its arguably most transformative and revelatory capacity, it is the power that enables us to empathise with humans whose experiences we have never shared.

One of the greatest formative experiences of my life preceded Harry Potter, though it informed much of what I subsequently wrote in those books. This revelation came in the form of one of my earliest day jobs. Though I was sloping off to write stories during my lunch hours, I paid the rent in my early 20s by working at the African research department at Amnesty International's headquarters in London.

There in my little office I read hastily scribbled letters smuggled out of totalitarian regimes by men and women who were risking imprisonment to inform the outside world of what was happening to them. I saw photographs of those who had disappeared without trace, sent to Amnesty by their desperate families and friends.

Every day of my working week in my early 20s I was reminded how incredibly fortunate I was, to live in a country with a democratically elected government, where legal representation and a public trial were the rights of everyone.

And yet I also learned more about human goodness at Amnesty International than I had ever known before.

Amnesty mobilises thousands of people who have never been tortured or imprisoned for their beliefs to act on behalf of those who have. The power of human empathy, leading to collective action, saves lives, and frees prisoners. Ordinary people, whose personal well-being and security are assured, join together in huge numbers to save people they do not know, and will never meet.

Unlike any other creature on this planet, humans can learn and understand, without having experienced. They can think themselves into other people's places.

Of course, this is a power, like my brand of fictional magic, that is morally neutral. One might use such an ability to manipulate, or control, just as much as to understand or sympathise.

And many prefer not to exercise their imaginations at all. They choose to remain comfortably within the bounds of their own experience, never troubling to wonder how it would feel to have been born other than they are.

What is more, those who choose not to empathise enable real monsters. For without ever committing an act of outright evil ourselves, we collude with it, through our own apathy.

One of the many things I learned at the end of that Classics corridor down which I ventured at the age of 18, in search of something I could not then define, was this, written by the Greek author Plutarch: What we achieve inwardly will change outer reality.

But how much more are you, Harvard graduates of 2008, likely to touch other people's lives? Your intelligence, your capacity for hard work, the education you have earned and received, give you unique status, and unique responsibilities.

If you choose to use your status and influence to raise your voice on behalf of those who have no voice; if you choose to identify not only with the powerful, but with the powerless; if you retain the ability to imagine yourself into the lives of those who do not have your advantages, then it will not only be your proud families who celebrate your existence, but thousands and millions of people whose reality you have helped change. We do not need magic to change the world, we carry all the power we need inside ourselves already: we have the power to imagine better.

I am nearly finished. I have one last hope for you, which is something that I already had at 21. The friends with whom I sat on graduation day have been my friends for life.

So today, I wish you nothing better than similar friendships. And tomorrow, I hope that even if you remember not a single word of mine, you remember those of Seneca, another of those old Romans I met when I fled down the Classics corridor, in retreat from career ladders, in search of ancient wisdom:

As is a tale, so is life: not how long it is, but how good it is, is what matters.

I wish you all very good lives. Thank-you very much.`
