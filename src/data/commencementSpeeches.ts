    fullText: `Good morning!

I am so happy to be here with you all. I'm proud to be here in the Big Easy. Look at you all! You look good.

Thank you. I want to start by thanking Nicole for that very kind introduction and for sharing her story, which is not too unfamiliar to me -- because they told me I couldn't be where I am, too. So I want to thank Nicole. I'm proud of her. Thank you for the selfie; I think that's the first selfie I've done at a commencement. So, Nicole, you're my first.

And of course, I want to thank the Dillard University Choir. Oh, oh, oh! Oh! That's all I can say. It's like you want to start something up in here, right? It's like, now we got a commencement going on up in here. That was beautiful, beautiful. Thank you so much.

I also want to recognize Senator Mary Landrieu, who is here. Let's give her a hand. She has been a strong supporter of this university.

I want to thank the Dillard University Board of Trustees. I want to thank the faculty, the staff, and, of course, your tremendous president, Dr. Walter Kimbrough. Now, my husband has been called a few things over the years, but he has never had the honor of being referred to as the "Hip Hop President."

I also want to thank all the folks from the University of New Orleans for hosting us here today. And I know they're hosting the folks at Southern University at New Orleans for their commencement later on today as well, so we wish them a wonderful day. And thank you for having us.

And of course, I've got to give a big shout-out to all the family members in the crowd, all of the family members -- especially to the mothers, because it is the day before Mother's Day. To all the mothers, Happy Mother's Day.

Now, graduates, you all handled your business, right? Just because you were graduating didn't mean you -- come on, now. Okay, well, if you didn't, you have my permission to get up and go right now, because there is nothing more important -- no, no, don't get up. Your mothers would kill you if you got up at this moment. So just stay in your seats, and when this is all over make sure you take care of mom.

But in all seriousness, to all the moms out there -- as well as the dads and the grandparents, the uncles, the aunts, the brothers, the sisters, all of you who have helped raise these graduates -- you have seen them through their ups and downs, and you have poured your hearts and souls into these men and women. So today is your day, too, and you should be very proud. You really should.

And finally, most of all, I want to congratulate the beautiful and handsome men and women of the Dillard University Class of 2014. Yay! You all have come so far, I know, to make it to this day -- from all those early days when the girls were sneaking out of Williams Hall to go see the boys over at the Duals -- oh yeah, I did my research -- to all those tests you crammed for, to the plans you're making now for your careers, to go on to graduate school.

You all have seen so much. You've witnessed this school's rebirth after the devastation of Hurricane Katrina -- the new buildings that replaced the ones you lost, the classrooms that started filling back up again, the service projects that you all have done to help this community bounce back. And I know along the way that each of you has written your own story of resilience and determination to make it here to this day.

For example, as you heard, Nicole was told back in high school that she just wasn't college material. But now she is your class president, and she's headed off to Yale for her graduate degree. So there. That's it.

And I know that some of you may come from tough neighborhoods; some of you may have lost your homes during Katrina. Maybe you're like DeShawn Dabney, a graduate who was raised by his grandmother -- maybe -- that's your grandmother, isn't it, DeShawn? Raised by his grandmother while some of his family members were dealing with issues. Maybe just like him, you've been working part-time jobs since you were a teenager to make your dream of going to college come true. And now, today, you're all here ready to walk across this stage and get that diploma.

And no matter what path you took to get here, you all kept your hearts set on this day. You fought through every challenge you encountered, and you earned that degree from this fine university. And in doing so, you are following in the footsteps of all those who came before you, and you have become an indelible part of the history of this school -- a history that, as you all know, stretches back to well before the Civil War, back to 1826, the year a child named Emperor Williams was born.

Now, Emperor was born into slavery. But as he grew up, he managed to teach himself to read and write well enough to create a pass that allowed him to come and go around the city without getting hassled. But one day, his master saw the pass and he said, where did you learn to write like that? Now, just imagine the fear Emperor must have felt when he heard that question -- because remember, back then it was illegal for a slave to learn to read or write. So who knows what kind of punishment he may have gotten -- a beating, a whipping, even worse.

We don't exactly know what happened on that day, but we do know that when Emperor turned 32, after more than three decades in bondage, he became a free man. He decided to stay in New Orleans, and he went on to become a minister -- even founded a church right here in town. And in 1869, when abolitionists, missionaries, black folks and white folks came together to create a school for freed slaves here in New Orleans, Emperor was one of the original signers of the charter.

They decided to name the school New Orleans University, because even though most of the classes would be taught at a high school level or below, oh, their aspirations were much higher than that. And when they laid the cornerstone for that university's first building down on St. Charles Avenue, Emperor got a chance to speak.

He said -- and these are his words -- he said, "For twenty years I was a slave on these streets. It was a penitentiary offense to educate a Negro. I have seen my fellow-servants whipped for trying to learn; but today here am I, speaking where a building is to be erected for the education of the children of my people." He goes on to say, "I wonder if this is the world I was born in."

See, in the course of his short lifetime, Emperor saw education go from being a crime for black folks to being a real possibility for his kids and grandkids. So no wonder he was asking whether this was the same world he'd been born into. See, for a man like Emperor, getting an education could open up a whole new world of opportunity. An education meant having real power. It meant you could manage your own money. It meant you couldn't get swindled out of land or possessions when somebody told you to just sign on the dotted line; sometimes even determined whether or not you could vote.

So most folks back then saw education as the key to real and lasting freedom. That's why, when New Orleans University and the other African American college in town, Straight University, first opened their doors, one of the biggest problems they faced was too many students. That's right -- too many students. Many of these students barely spoke English; they'd grown up speaking Creole or French. Few had ever seen the inside of a classroom or even been taught their ABCs.

But let me tell you, those students were hungry -- you hear me? Hungry. They studied like their lives depended on it. They blazed through their lessons. And that hunger for education lasted for generations in the African American community here in New Orleans.

When an arsonist set fire to the school's library in 1877, they built a new one. When those two original schools ran into financial troubles years later, they started making plans to build an even bigger and better university. And in the 1930s, when white folks complained that this new school would mean too many black students on their buses, the folks at the school got the city to add a bus line just for their students, because nothing -- nothing -- was going to stop them from achieving the vision of those early founders.

And finally, in May of 1934, they broke ground for this school, Dillard University -- a university that would go on to produce some of the leading thinkers and achievers in our country. And the day the cornerstone was laid for your library, the President of Howard University spoke these words: He said, "There lies in this Southland today, buried in unmarked graves, many a black genius who would have blessed this city and this section of our country, if only his parents could have had before them the Dillard University you are now building."

And in the years since then, through segregation and depression, through threats of violence and the floodwaters of a devastating storm, students like you have come here to study and to learn, and to carry forward those hopes and dreams. And today, I stand before a sea of young geniuses. Oh, yeah.

So, graduates, I hope that you understand that this day is not just the culmination of your own dreams, but the realization of the dreams of so many who came before you. And you should be so proud, and so happy, and so excited about your futures. But what you shouldn't be is satisfied. See, because while it is a wonderful thing that all of you are here today, we have to ask ourselves, what about all those geniuses who never get this chance?

I'm talking about the young people from right here in New Orleans and across the country who aren't part of a commencement like this one today, kids no different from all of us, kids who never made it out of high school. The fact is that today, the high school graduation rate for black students is improving, but it is still lower than just about any other group in this country. And while college graduation rates have risen for nearly every other demographic, including African American women, the college graduation rate for African American men has flatlined.

See, and the thing is, when our young people fall behind like that in school, they fall behind in life. Last year, African Americans were more than twice as likely as whites to be unemployed. They were almost three times as likely to live in poverty. And they were far more likely to end up in prison or be the victims of violent crimes.

Now, perhaps when you hear these statistics, you might think to yourself, well, those numbers are terrible, but I'm not part of the problem. And you might be thinking that since you're not one of those statistics, and you're sitting here wearing that nice black robe today, you can go on your way and never look back.

But folks like you and me, we can't afford to think like that -- never. See, because we're the lucky ones, and we can never forget that we didn't get where we are today all on our own. We got here today because of so many people who toiled and sweat and bled and died for us -- people like our parents and grandparents and all those who came before them, people who never dreamed of getting a college education themselves but who worked, and saved, and sacrificed so that we could be here today. We owe them. We owe them.

And the only way to pay back that debt is by making those same kinds of sacrifices and investments for the next generation. And I know sitting here right now, that task could seem a bit overwhelming. I know it could seem like the deck is stacked way too high against our young people. And the truth is that some of the problems we face -- structural inequality, schools that lag behind, workplace and housing discrimination -- those problems are too big for one person to fix on their own.

But that's still no excuse to stand on the sidelines. Because we know that today, education is still the key to real and lasting freedom -- it is still true today. So it is now up to us to cultivate that hunger for education in our own lives and in those around us. And we know that hunger is still out there -- we know it.

We see it in students like DeShawn and Nicole and all of you who scraped and clawed so you could make it to this day. We see it in the single moms who work three jobs so their kids might have a shot at earning a degree like yours. We see that hunger all around the world -- in that young woman named Malala who was shot on her school bus in Pakistan just for speaking out in support of girls getting an education, and the more than 200 girls kidnapped from their own school in Nigeria for wanting an education -- young people who are knowingly risking their lives every day just to go to school.

And in fact, you've seen that hunger right here at Dillard: your valedictorian, three salutatorians are all from Nigeria. They studied hard at an early age, earned scholarships to come here to this university, achieved 4.0 GPAs. And now they are off pursuing master's degrees, work in software development, teaching math and science to young people here in the United States.

See, now, that's the kind of hunger for education that we have to reignite in all of our communities. It's the same hunger that gave life to this university, the same hunger that defined so many of our parents and grandparents -- including my own. You see, my parents never went to college, but they were determined to see me and my brother and all the kids in our neighborhood get a good education.

So my mother volunteered at my school -- helping out every day in the front office, making sure our teachers were doing their jobs, holding their feet to the fire if she thought they were falling short. I'd walk by the office and there she'd be. I'd leave class to go to the bathroom, there she'd be again, roaming the halls, looking in the classrooms. And of course, as a kid, I have to say, that was a bit mortifying, having your mother at school all the time.

But looking back, I have no doubt that my classmates and I got a better education because she was looking over those teachers' shoulders. You see, my mom was not a teacher or a principal or a school board member. But when it came to education, she had that hunger. So she believed that our education was very much her business.

And we need more people who think and act like my mother, and all those mothers out there, because the education of our young people is all of our business. That's what Emperor Williams thought. That's what the folks here in New Orleans thought as they worked to rebuild this campus after Katrina. And as graduates of Dillard University, that's how we need you to think every single day for the rest of your lives.

You all have opportunities and skills and education that so many folks who came before you never could have dreamed of. So just imagine the kind of impact that you're going to make. Imagine how you can inspire those around you to reach higher and complete their own education.

And you can start small. Start by volunteering at an after-school program, or helping some high school kids fill out their college applications. Show them the path that you took. Or you can think a little bigger -- you can get your entire congregation or your community to start a mentoring program; maybe convince your new employer to sponsor scholarships for underprivileged kids. Or maybe you could think a little higher -- maybe you could run for school board or Congress, or, yes, even President of the United States.

And then maybe you could build preschools for every single one of our kids. Maybe you could help turn that pipeline to prison into a highway to college; help give every child in America an education that is truly worth of their promise. Those are the kind of big dreams that folks who founded this university reached for. That is how high they set their bar.

And so we owe it to those folks -- the folks who had the audacity to call their little schools "universities" and name their baby boys "Emperor" -- we owe it to them to reach as high as they did, and to bring others along the way. As the history of this school has taught us, no dream is too big, no vision is too bold; as long as we stay hungry for education and let that hunger be our North Star, there is nothing, graduates, nothing that we cannot achieve.

So, graduates, that is your mission. This is your obligation. I want you to keep reaching higher. I want you all to keep raising your bars. Let the next generation know that there is no greater investment than a good education. And if you do all of this, then I am confident that you will uphold that duty and write your own chapter into the legacy of this great university. And let me tell you something, I cannot wait to see the world that your children will be born into.

Congratulations. I love you all. I am honored to be here. I am proud of you. God bless you. And thank your families.`

    fullText: `Alright, thank you.

So, I've got about apparently I've got about five to six minutes to say the most useful things I can think of.

I'm gonna do my best.

It was suggested that I distill things down to 3 items.

I think I'll go with four.

And I'll try, I think, I think these are pretty important ones.

Some of it may kinda sound like, well you've heard them before.

But, you know, worth reemphasizing.

I think the first is, you need to work, if you, depending on how well you want to do, particularly if you want to start a company, you need to work super hard.

So what is super hard mean?

Well, when my brother and I were starting our first company, instead of getting an apartment, we just rented a small office and we slept on the couch and we showered in the YMCA.

We're so hard up that we had just one computer.

So the website was up during the day, and I was coding at night.

7 days a week, all the time.

And I, sort of briefly had a girlfriend in that period and in order to be with me, she had to sleep in the office.

So, work hard, like, every waking hour.

That's the thing I would say, particularly if you're starting a company.

And I mean, if you do the simple math, you say like somebody else is working 50 hours a week and you're working 100, you'll get twice as done, as much done, in the course of the year as the other company.

The other thing I'd say is that if you're creating a company, or if you're joining a company, the most important thing is to attract great people.

So either be with, join a group that's amazing, that you really respect.

Or, if you're building a company, you've got to gather great people.

I mean, all a company is is a group of people that have gathered together to create a product or service.

So depending upon how talented and hard working that group is, and to the degree in which they are focused cohesively in a good direction, that will determine the success of the company.

So, do everything you can to gather great people, if you're creating a company.

Then, I'd say focus on signal over noise.

A lot of companies get confused.

They spend a lot of money on things that don't actually make the product better.

So, for example, at Tesla, we've never spent any money on advertising.

We've put all the money into R and D and manufacturing and design to try and make the car as good as possible.

And, I think that's the way to go. For any given company, keep thinking about, "Are, these efforts that people are expending, are they resulting in a better product or service?"

And if they're not, stop those efforts.

And then the final thing is, is to sort of, don't just follow the trend.

So, you may have heard me say that it's good to thinking terms of the physics approach, the first principles.

With is, rather than reasoning by analogy, you boil things down to the most fundamental truths you can imagine, and then you reason up from there.

And this is a good way to figure out if something really makes sense, or is it just what everybody else is doing.

It's hard to think that way, you can't think that way about everything.

It takes a lot of effort. But if you're trying to do something new, it's the best way to thing.

And that framework was developed by physicists to figure out counter intuitive things, like quantum mechanics.

It's really a powerful, powerful method.

And anyways, so that's, and then the final thing I would encourage you to do is now is the time to take risks.

You don't have kids, you're obligations, well! Some of you… Hahaha, you probably don't have kids.

But as you get older, your obligations start to increase.

So, and, once you have a family, you start taking risks not just for yourself, but for your family as well.

It gets harder to do things that might not work out. So now is the time to do that.

Before you have those obligations. So I would encourage you to take risks now, and to do something bold.

You won't regret it. Thank you.

I don't know if it was helpful. Great.`

I am honored to be here. I am honored to be here with all of you. I am honored to be here with the class of 2015.

I want to start by telling you something that I wish somebody had told me when I was sitting where you are today. And it is this: You don't have to be grateful for everything.

I know this sounds strange, coming from somebody who has been as fortunate as I have been. But I think gratitude is important, and I think it's important to be grateful for the good things in your life. But I also think it's important to be angry about the bad things. And I think it's important to be angry about injustice.

All over the world, girls are raised to make themselves likeable, to twist themselves into shapes that suit other people. Please do not twist yourself into shapes to please. Don't do it. If someone likes that version of you, that version of you that is false and holds back, then they actually just like that twisted shape, and not you. And the world is such a gloriously multifaceted, diverse place that there are people in the world who will like you, the real you, as you are.

I want to talk to you about being a young woman in the world. And the first thing I want to say is this: Be a full person. A full person is a complicated thing. You can be intelligent and a good cook. You can be a good cook and be not-so-good at math. You can love fashion and love physics. You can be a whole person.

I think we do a great disservice to boys in how we raise them. We stifle the humanity of boys. We define masculinity in a very narrow way. Masculinity is a hard, small cage, and we put boys inside this cage.

We teach boys to be afraid of fear, of weakness, of vulnerability. We teach them to mask their true selves, because they have to be, in Nigerian-speak, a hard man.

But by doing this, we rob them of a full range of human emotions. We rob them of the ability to be vulnerable, which is the birthplace of innovation, of creativity, of change.

The problem with gender is that it prescribes how we should be rather than recognizing how we are. Imagine how much happier we would be, how much freer to be our true individual selves, if we didn't have the weight of gender expectations.

I want to talk about work. I want you to reject the idea of work-life balance. The phrase 'work-life balance' is not only impossible to achieve; it's also a trap. It assumes that work is separate from life, when in fact, work is part of life.

Instead, I want you to think about work-life integration. How can you integrate your work into your life in a way that makes sense for you? How can you make your work meaningful? How can you make your life meaningful?

And please, when you get that first job, and you will, don't spend your time trying to make your boss happy. Spend your time trying to do good work. Good work speaks for itself.

I want to talk about love. Love is not something that you find. Love is something that you create. Love is something that you build. Love is something that you work at every single day.

And when you love, love fully. Love with your whole heart. Love without reservation. But also love with your eyes wide open. Love does not mean that you have to lose yourself.

I want to talk about failure. You will fail. I have failed many times. Failure is not the opposite of success; it's part of success. When you fail, and you will, don't let it define you. Let it teach you.

I want to talk about feminism. I am a feminist. And I think you should be feminists too. Feminism is not about hating men. It's about justice. It's about fairness. It's about giving women the same opportunities that men have.

Some people ask me, 'Why do you call yourself a feminist? Why not just say you believe in human rights?' The reason is that for centuries, women have been excluded from the idea of what it means to be human. Feminism is about including women in the idea of what it means to be human.

I want to end by saying this: You are graduating from one of the finest institutions in the world. You have been given an incredible gift. But with that gift comes responsibility. You have a responsibility to use your education, your privilege, your voice to make the world a better place.

The world needs you. The world needs your ideas, your energy, your passion. The world needs you to be brave, to be bold, to be unapologetically yourselves.

So go out there and create the world you want to live in. Go out there and be the change you want to see. Go out there and be magnificent.

Thank you.`

It's an honor to be here with you today. And I have to say, I'm a little nervous. The last time I spoke at a university commencement, the students gave me a standing ovation. Of course, that was because I told them I was cutting my remarks short.

But seriously, I'm thrilled to be here at one of America's great public universities. UNC has been a beacon of excellence for more than two centuries, and you graduates are carrying on that tradition.

Now, I know that some of you may be wondering: What's a guy from New York doing here in Chapel Hill? Well, the truth is, I've always had a soft spot for North Carolina. After all, this is the state that gave us Michael Jordan, and as a lifelong basketball fan, I have to respect that.

But I'm really here because I believe in what this university represents: the power of public education to transform lives and communities. And I believe in what you represent: the next generation of leaders who will shape our world.

Now, I want to share with you some lessons I've learned over the years. And the first one is this: Follow your heart, and go with your gut.

When I was your age, I thought I had my life all figured out. I was going to be an engineer, work for a big company, climb the corporate ladder. But life had other plans.

After business school, I took a job on Wall Street. I loved the energy, the competition, the fast pace. But then, in 1981, I got fired. At the time, it felt like the end of the world. But it turned out to be the beginning of something much better.

I used my severance package to start Bloomberg LP. People thought I was crazy. Here I was, competing against established giants like Reuters and Dow Jones. But I believed we could do it better.

And you know what? We did. Today, Bloomberg is a global company with more than 15,000 employees in 192 locations around the world.

The lesson here is simple: Don't be afraid to take risks. Don't be afraid to fail. Some of the best opportunities come disguised as disasters.

The second lesson I want to share is this: Out-hustle the competition.

There's no substitute for hard work. Show up early, stay late, and always be prepared. When I was starting Bloomberg, I worked seven days a week. I slept in the office. I did whatever it took.

Now, I'm not saying you should sacrifice your health or your relationships. But I am saying that if you want to succeed, you have to be willing to work harder than the next person.

And don't be afraid to throw some elbows when necessary. Business is competitive. Politics is competitive. Life is competitive. If you're not willing to fight for what you believe in, someone else will take it from you.

The third lesson is about teamwork. No one succeeds alone. Surround yourself with people who are smarter than you, who challenge you, who make you better.

At Bloomberg, we've always believed that diversity makes us stronger. We hire the best people, regardless of their background, their gender, their race, their religion. And that diversity of thought and experience has been one of our greatest competitive advantages.

The fourth lesson is about giving back. Success isn't just about what you achieve for yourself. It's about what you do for others.

I've been fortunate in my life. I've been able to build a successful business, serve as mayor of New York City, and now focus on philanthropy. But none of that would have been possible without the opportunities that others gave me.

That's why I believe so strongly in public education, in public health, in public service. These are the institutions that give everyone a chance to succeed, regardless of where they come from.

And that brings me to my final lesson: Don't make decisions based on money alone.

I know that many of you are graduating with student loans. I know that you're worried about finding a job, paying your bills, starting your careers. Those are legitimate concerns.

But don't let money be the only factor in your decisions. Do what you love. Find a way to get paid for it. And if you ever have the luxury of multiple job offers, don't make the decision based on salary alone.

Choose the job that will teach you the most, that will challenge you the most, that will give you the best foundation for the rest of your career.

Money will come and go. But the skills you learn, the relationships you build, the impact you make – those things will last forever.

So as you leave here today, remember these lessons: Follow your heart. Work hard. Build great teams. Give back. And don't let money be your only guide.

The world needs your energy, your ideas, your passion. The world needs you to solve problems, to create opportunities, to make a difference.

You have the education, the tools, and the talent to do amazing things. Now go out there and do them.

Congratulations, Class of 2012. The future is yours.

Thank you.`

Wow, what an honor to be here today. Thank you, President Nikias. Thank you, Board of Trustees. Faculty, families, and most importantly, graduates of USC Class of 2011!

I have to tell you, I am pumped to be here! This is fantastic! USC! Fight on!

You know, when I was asked to speak here today, I was thrilled. USC has always held a special place in my heart. This is a university that understands passion, that understands excellence, that understands what it means to fight on!

And that's what I want to talk to you about today: passion, ideas, and tenacity. These three things – boom! – bake them in, and they'll really take you a long way.

Let me start with ideas. Great ideas matter. They can change everything. They can change your life, they can change the world.

When I was at Harvard Business School, I had a professor who said something that stuck with me. He said, "The power of an idea is not in its complexity, but in its ability to change how people think and act."

That's what happened with Microsoft. Bill Gates and Paul Allen had an idea: a computer on every desk and in every home. People thought they were crazy. Computers were these massive machines that filled entire rooms. But they had a vision, and they pursued it with passion.

And look what happened. Today, there are billions of computers around the world. That idea changed everything.

But here's the thing about ideas: they're not enough by themselves. You need passion to bring them to life.

Passion is your job to discover. It's not something that just happens to you. You have to go out and find it. You have to try things, experiment, take risks.

I found my passion in technology, in software, in the incredible potential of what we could build. But your passion might be completely different. It might be in medicine, in education, in art, in business, in public service.

The key is to keep looking until you find it. And when you do find it, embrace it with everything you've got.

Because here's what I've learned: when you're passionate about something, work doesn't feel like work. Challenges become opportunities. Obstacles become puzzles to solve.

At Microsoft, we used to have this saying: "We're not just building software, we're changing the world." That passion, that sense of purpose, that's what drove us to work those crazy hours, to push through the difficult times, to never give up.

Which brings me to the third thing: tenacity. Be tenacious. Be irrepressible.

You're going to face setbacks. You're going to face failures. You're going to face people who tell you that your ideas won't work, that you're not good enough, that you should give up.

Don't listen to them. Be tenacious.

When I joined Microsoft in 1980, we were a small company with big dreams. We faced competition from much larger companies. We made mistakes. We had products that failed.

But we never gave up. We kept pushing, kept innovating, kept believing in our vision.

And you know what? That tenacity paid off. Microsoft became one of the most successful companies in the world, and we helped usher in the personal computer revolution.

But tenacity isn't just about business success. It's about life success. It's about not giving up on your dreams, your relationships, your values.

It's about getting back up every time you get knocked down. It's about learning from your failures and using them to become stronger.

Now, I want to talk specifically about USC and why I think this university is so special.

USC has a culture that promotes passion and tenacity. This is a place where people dream big and work hard to achieve those dreams.

Look around you. Look at your classmates. These are people who didn't just coast through college. These are people who got involved, who took risks, who pushed themselves to be better.

That's the USC spirit. That's what "Fight On" really means. It means never giving up. It means always striving for excellence. It means having the courage to pursue your dreams, no matter how big they are.

And that spirit, that culture, that's something you'll carry with you for the rest of your lives.

So as you leave here today, remember these three things: Ideas matter. Find your passion. Be tenacious.

The world needs your ideas. The world needs your passion. The world needs your tenacity.

You're graduating at an incredible time. Technology is advancing at an unprecedented pace. Global challenges require innovative solutions. There are opportunities everywhere for people who are willing to think big and work hard.

Don't be afraid to take risks. Don't be afraid to fail. Don't be afraid to dream big.

You have the education, the skills, and the USC spirit to do amazing things. Now go out there and do them!

Fight on, Class of 2011! Fight on!

Thank you!`

Dean Khurana, faculty, proud parents, and graduates, thank you so much for letting me share this amazing day with you.

As I look out at all of you, I'm reminded of my own graduation day and how excited I was to get started with my life. I'm sure you feel the same way.

Today I want to talk to you about gifts and choices. Cleverness is a gift, kindness is a choice. Gifts are easy -- they're given after all. Choices can be hard.

You can seduce yourself with your gifts if you're not careful, and if you do, it'll probably be to the detriment of your choices.

This is a group with many gifts. I'm sure one of your gifts is the gift of a sharp and creative mind. I'm also sure you have other gifts, and I'm sure you've worked hard to develop them.

When I was 12 years old, I was a garage inventor. I invented an automatic gate closer out of cement-filled tires, a solar cooker that didn't work very well, and a device to entrap my siblings.

Yesterday, as I was preparing this speech, I called my mom to ask her what she remembered about that time. She said what she remembered was that I was always making a mess and never cleaning it up. Fair point.

You know what she didn't say? She didn't say, "Well, you were gifted." She said I was always making a mess. That's not about gifts, that's about choices.

I will hazard a prediction. When you are 80 years old, and in a quiet moment of reflection narrating for only yourself the most personal version of your life story, the telling that will be most compact and meaningful will be the series of choices you have made. In the end, we are our choices.

Build yourself a great story.

Thank you, and congratulations to the class of 2010.

I want to talk about choice. You can choose to be lazy or you can choose to work hard. You can choose to follow your passions or you can choose to follow the safe path.

When I graduated from Princeton in 1986, I had offers from Wall Street firms, and I had this crazy idea about starting something called an online bookstore.

Most people, including my parents, thought I was making a mistake. They said, "You have a good job on Wall Street. Why would you give that up for something that probably won't work?"

But I had what I called a "regret minimization framework." I projected myself forward to age 80 and asked: Will I regret not trying this thing that I'm passionate about?

The answer was clear. I knew I would regret not trying more than I would regret failing.

So I left my job, drove across the country with my wife, and started Amazon in a garage in Bellevue, Washington.

It wasn't easy. For the first few years, I was packing books on my hands and knees on a concrete floor. We couldn't afford desks, so we made them out of doors from Home Depot.

But I was following my passion, and that made all the difference.

Today, Amazon is one of the largest companies in the world. But more importantly, we've been able to create hundreds of thousands of jobs and serve millions of customers.

None of that would have happened if I had chosen the safe path.

So my advice to you is this: Follow your passion. Take risks. Don't be afraid to fail.

But also remember that with great gifts come great responsibilities. You have been given so much. You have brilliant minds, you have access to incredible resources, you have opportunities that most people in the world can only dream of.

What are you going to do with those gifts?

Are you going to use them just for yourself? Or are you going to use them to make the world a better place?

I hope you choose the latter.

The world needs your energy, your passion, your creativity. The world needs you to solve big problems, to create new opportunities, to build a better future.

So as you leave here today, remember: Cleverness is a gift, kindness is a choice. Gifts are easy, choices can be hard.

Choose to be kind. Choose to work hard. Choose to follow your passion. Choose to make a difference.

In the end, we are our choices. Build yourself a great story.

Congratulations, Class of 2010. Thank you.`

Today marks not just the end of your academic journey, but the beginning of your mission to transform our world. As I stand before you, I am reminded of the power that education holds - a power that no one can take away from you.

Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world. No country can really develop unless its citizens are educated. You, the graduates of today, are the architects of tomorrow's Africa, tomorrow's world.

I have lived through times when education was denied to many because of the color of their skin. I have seen how ignorance breeds fear, and how fear breeds hatred. But I have also witnessed the transformative power of knowledge, the way it can break down barriers and build bridges between people.

During my 27 years in prison, I never stopped learning. I read everything I could get my hands on. I studied law, history, philosophy. Education became my companion in the darkest hours, my hope for a better future. It taught me that no matter how dark the night, the sun will rise again.

You have been privileged to receive an education that many in our continent still dream of. With this privilege comes responsibility. You must use your knowledge not just to better your own lives, but to lift up those around you.

A good head and a good heart are always a formidable combination. But when you add to that a literate tongue or pen, then you have something very special. You have the tools to change the world.

Remember, it always seems impossible until it's done. When I was your age, the idea of a free, democratic South Africa seemed like an impossible dream. Yet here we are today, living proof that the impossible can become possible when people are educated, determined, and united in their purpose.

The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall. You will face challenges, setbacks, and moments of doubt. But remember that every great achievement was once considered impossible by somebody.

As you leave this institution, carry with you the knowledge that you are not just individuals with degrees, but agents of change. You have the power to heal the wounds of the past, to build bridges across divides, and to create a future where every child, regardless of their background, has access to quality education.

Africa needs you. The world needs you. But most importantly, you need to believe in yourselves and in your power to make a difference.

Go forth and change the world. The future is in your hands.

Thank you, and congratulations to the Class of 2003.`

    ],
    fullText: `Dear graduates, faculty, and distinguished guests,

Today, as you celebrate this remarkable achievement, I want to share with you a simple truth that has guided my life: the power of small actions to create monumental change.

When I started the Green Belt Movement in 1977, I began with a simple idea - to plant trees. People thought I was crazy. "How can planting trees solve our problems?" they asked. But I believed that small actions, when multiplied by millions of people, can transform the world.

You cannot protect the environment unless you empower people, you cannot empower people unless you democratize knowledge and access to information, and you cannot democratize knowledge and access to information unless you have a democratic space.

Education is the foundation of democracy. It is what has brought you here today, and it is what will enable you to participate fully in shaping the future of our continent and our planet.

As I speak to you today, I think of the millions of women across Africa who are still denied access to education, who are still marginalized in decision-making processes. Yet these are the very women who are most affected by environmental degradation, who walk miles to fetch water, who struggle to feed their families when the rains fail.

Your education gives you a responsibility to speak for those who cannot speak for themselves, to act for those who cannot act for themselves.

The environment and women's rights are not separate issues - they are interconnected. When we destroy our forests, we destroy the livelihoods of women who depend on them. When we pollute our water sources, we burden women who must walk further to find clean water.

But when we plant trees, we create jobs for women. When we protect our watersheds, we ensure that communities have access to clean water. When we practice sustainable agriculture, we empower small-scale farmers, most of whom are women.

I want you to understand that you don't need to wait for someone else to solve the world's problems. You don't need to wait for permission to make a difference. Start where you are, with what you have.

If you see a problem, don't complain about it - do something about it. If you see injustice, don't just talk about it - act against it. If you see environmental destruction, don't just worry about it - work to restore it.

Remember, the little grasshopper can move mountains when it acts together with other grasshoppers. You are not alone in this work. You are part of a generation that has the knowledge, the tools, and the passion to heal our planet.

As you leave this university, carry with you the understanding that your education is not just for your personal advancement, but for the advancement of all humanity. Use your knowledge to bridge divides, to heal wounds, to plant seeds of hope.

The future of Africa, the future of our planet, depends on educated, committed young people like you. Go forth and be the change you wish to see in the world.

Congratulations, and may you always remember the power of small actions to create big changes.

Thank you.`

    fullText: `Distinguished graduates, esteemed faculty, and honored guests,

Today, I stand before you not just as a businessman, but as a proud African who believes deeply in the potential of our continent and our people.

Africa is not a country, it's a continent of 54 countries with over a billion people. We have everything we need to succeed - abundant natural resources, a young and dynamic population, and now, increasingly, good governance.

For too long, Africa has been defined by what we lack rather than what we have. We have been told stories of poverty, conflict, and despair. But I am here to tell you a different story - a story of opportunity, innovation, and hope.

You, the graduates sitting before me today, are living proof of this new African narrative. You represent the best of what our continent has to offer - educated, ambitious, and ready to take on the world.

When I started Celtel, many people told me I was crazy to invest in African telecommunications. "Africans don't need mobile phones," they said. "The infrastructure isn't there." But I believed in the potential of our people, and I was right.

Today, Africa has more mobile phone subscribers than Europe or North America. We have leapfrogged fixed-line technology and gone straight to mobile. We have created mobile banking systems that are now being copied around the world. This is the power of African innovation.

But technology alone is not enough. We need good governance. We need leaders who are accountable to their people, who are transparent in their dealings, and who put the interests of their citizens first.

This is why I established the Mo Ibrahim Foundation and the Ibrahim Prize for Achievement in African Leadership. We must celebrate and reward good governance, because without it, all our natural resources and human potential mean nothing.

Young people like you are Africa's greatest asset. You are more educated than any generation before you. You are more connected to the world than any generation before you. You have access to information and opportunities that previous generations could only dream of.

But with these advantages comes responsibility. You have a responsibility to use your education not just for personal gain, but for the betterment of your communities and your countries.

Don't let anyone tell you that you need to leave Africa to succeed. Yes, the world is global, and you should think globally. But remember that some of the greatest opportunities in the world today are right here on our continent.

Africa is the fastest-growing continent in the world. We have six of the ten fastest-growing economies globally. We have a middle class that is expanding rapidly. We have cities that are becoming major economic hubs.

The question is not whether Africa will rise - it's whether you will be part of that rise.

I challenge you to think big, to dream big, to act big. Don't be satisfied with small thinking or small actions. Africa needs big solutions to big challenges, and you are the ones who can provide them.

Whether you become entrepreneurs, doctors, teachers, engineers, or leaders in any field, remember that you are not just building careers - you are building the future of Africa.

The time for excuses is over. The time for waiting for someone else to solve our problems is over. Africa's time is now, and your time is now.

Go forth and make us proud. Go forth and make Africa proud. Go forth and show the world what we are truly capable of.

Congratulations, Class of 2015. The future of Africa is in your hands.

Thank you.`

    fullText: `Thank you, President Hennessy, and to the trustees and the faculty, to all of the parents and grandparents, to you, the Stanford graduates. Thank you for letting me share this amazing day with you.

I need to begin by letting everyone in on a little secret. The secret is that Kirby Bumpus, Stanford Class of '08, is my goddaughter. So, I was thrilled when President Hennessy asked me to be your Commencement speaker, because this is the first time I've been allowed on campus since Kirby's been here.

You see, Kirby's a very smart girl. She wants people to get to know her on her own terms, she says. Not in terms of who she knows. So, she never wants anyone who's first meeting her to know that I know her and she knows me.

But I also know why my dad was insisting on that diploma, because, as B. B. King put it, "The beautiful thing about learning is that nobody can take that away from you." And learning is really in the broadest sense what I want to talk about today, because your education, of course, isn't ending here. In many ways, it's only just begun.

The world has so many lessons to teach you. I consider the world, this Earth, to be like a school and our life the classrooms. And sometimes here in this Planet Earth school the lessons often come dressed up as detours or roadblocks. And sometimes as full-blown crises. And the secret I've learned to getting ahead is being open to the lessons, lessons from the grandest university of all, that is, the universe itself.

It's being able to walk through life eager and open to self-improvement and that which is going to best help you evolve, 'cause that's really why we're here, to evolve as human beings. To grow into more of ourselves, always moving to the next level of understanding, the next level of compassion and growth.

So, today, I just want to share a few lessons—meaning three—that I've learned in my journey so far. The three lessons that have had the greatest impact on my life have to do with feelings, with failure and with finding happiness.

A year after I left college, I was given the opportunity to co-anchor the 6 o'clock news in Baltimore. So, I was 22 years old, making $22,000 a year. And it's where I met my best friend, Gayle, who was an intern at the same TV station.

So, here I am, 22, making $22,000 a year and, yet, it didn't feel right. The first sign was when they tried to change my name. The news director said to me at the time, "Nobody's going to remember Oprah. So, we want to change your name. We've come up with a name we think that people will remember and people will like. It's a friendly name: Suzie."

But my name wasn't Suzie. So, I thought, no, it doesn't feel right. I'm not going to change my name. And if people remember it or not, that's OK.

And then they said they didn't like the way I looked. So, they sent me to a salon where they gave me a perm, and after a few days all my hair fell out and I had to shave my head. And then they really didn't like the way I looked.

But even worse than being bald, I really hated, hated, hated being sent to report on other people's tragedies as a part of my daily duty, knowing that I was just expected to observe, when everything in my instinct told me that I should be doing something, I should be lending a hand.

And after eight months, I lost that job. They said I was too emotional. I was too much. But since they didn't want to pay out the contract, they put me on a talk show in Baltimore. And the moment I sat down on that show, the moment I did, I felt like I'd come home. I realized that TV could be more than just a playground, but a platform for service, for helping other people lift their lives. And the moment I sat down, doing that talk show, it felt like breathing. It felt right. And that's where everything that followed for me began.

And I got that lesson. When you're doing the work you're meant to do, it feels right and every day is a bonus, regardless of what you're getting paid.

And how do you know when you're doing something right? How do you know that? It feels so. What I know now is that feelings are really your GPS system for life. When you're supposed to do something or not supposed to do something, your emotional guidance system lets you know. The trick is to learn to check your ego at the door and start checking your gut instead. Every right decision I've made—every right decision I've ever made—has come from my gut. And every wrong decision I've ever made was a result of me not listening to the greater voice of myself.

If it doesn't feel right, don't do it. That's the lesson. And that lesson alone will save you, my friends, a lot of grief. Even doubt means don't.

So, I say to you, forget about the fast lane. If you really want to fly, just harness your power to your passion. Honor your calling. Everybody has one. Trust your heart and success will come to you.

So, how do I define success? Let me tell you, money's pretty nice. I'm not going to stand up here and tell you that it's not about money, 'cause money is very nice. I like money. It's good for buying things.

But having a lot of money does not automatically make you a successful person. What you want is money and meaning. You want your work to be meaningful. Because meaning is what brings the real richness to your life. What you really want is to be surrounded by people you trust and treasure and by people who cherish you. That's when you're really rich.

So, lesson one, follow your feelings. If it feels right, move forward. If it doesn't feel right, don't do it.

Now I want to talk a little bit about failings, because nobody's journey is seamless or smooth. We all stumble. We all have setbacks. If things go wrong, you hit a dead end—as you will—it's just life's way of saying time to change course. So, ask every failure—this is what I do with every failure, every crisis, every difficult time—I say, what is this here to teach me? And as soon as you get the lesson, you get to move on. If you really get the lesson, you pass and you don't have to repeat the class.

And what I've found is that difficulties come when you don't pay attention to life's whisper, because life always whispers to you first. And if you ignore the whisper, sooner or later you'll get a scream. Whatever you resist persists. But, if you ask the right question—not why is this happening, but what is this here to teach me?—it puts you in the place and space to get the lesson you need.

Many of you know that I started this school in Africa. And I founded the school, where I'm trying to give South African girls a shot at a future like yours—Stanford. And yet, last fall, I was faced with a crisis I had never anticipated.

And the whole time I kept asking that question: What is this here to teach me? And, as difficult as that experience has been, I got a lot of lessons. I understand now the mistakes I made, because I had been paying attention to all of the wrong things. I'd built that school from the outside in, when what really mattered was the inside out.

So, it's a lesson that applies to all of our lives as a whole. What matters most is what's inside. What matters most is the sense of integrity, of quality and beauty. I got that lesson.

This is what I know for sure: In order to be truly happy, you must live along with and you have to stand for something larger than yourself. Because life is a reciprocal exchange. To move forward you have to give back. And to me, that is the greatest lesson of life. To be happy, you have to give something back.

The lesson here is clear, and that is, if you're hurting, you need to help somebody ease their hurt. If you're in pain, help somebody else's pain. And when you're in a mess, you get yourself out of the mess helping somebody out of theirs. And in the process, you get to become a member of what I call the greatest fellowship of all, the sorority of compassion and the fraternity of service.

So, whatever field you choose, if you operate from the paradigm of service, I know your life will have more value and you will be happy.

So, let me end with one of my favorite quotes from Martin Luther King. Dr. King said, "Not everybody can be famous. But everybody can be great, because greatness is determined by service." He said, "You don't have to have a college degree to serve. You don't have to make your subject and verb agree to serve. You don't have to know about Plato or Aristotle to serve. You don't have to know Einstein's theory of relativity to serve. You only need a heart full of grace and a soul generated by love."

You have the heart and the smarts to go with it. And it's up to you to decide, really, where will you now use those gifts? You've got the diploma, so go out and get the lessons, 'cause I know great things are sure to come.

Congratulations, '08!`

    fullText: `I'm honored to be with you today for your commencement from one of the finest universities in the world. Truth be told, I never graduated from college. And this is the closest I've ever gotten to a college graduation.

Today I want to tell you three stories from my life. That's it. No big deal. Just three stories.

The first story is about connecting the dots. I dropped out of Reed College after the first six months, but then stayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so before I really quit. So why'd I drop out?

It started before I was born. My biological mother was a young, unwed graduate student, and she decided to put me up for adoption. She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates, so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife.

Except that when I popped out, they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl. So my parents, who were on a waiting list, got a call in the middle of the night asking, "We've got an unexpected baby boy. Do you want him?" They said, "Of course."

My biological mother found out later that my mother had never graduated from college, and that my father had never graduated from high school. She refused to sign the final adoption papers. She only relented a few months later, when my parents promised that I would go to college.

And 17 years later I did go to college. But I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford. And all of my working class parents' savings were being spent on my college tuition.

After six months, I couldn't see the value in it. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life, and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out. And here I was, spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life.

So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK. It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made.

The minute I dropped out, I could stop taking the required classes that didn't interest me, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked far more interesting.

It wasn't all romantic. I didn't have a dorm room, so I slept on the floor in friends' rooms. I returned Coke bottles for the five-cent deposits to buy food with. And I would walk the seven miles across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna temple. I loved it.

And much of what I stumbled into, by following my curiosity and intuition, turned out to be priceless later on. Let me give you one example.

Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country. Because I had dropped out, and didn't have to take the normal classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this. I learned about serif and sans-serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle, in a way that science can't capture. And I found it fascinating.

None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life. But ten years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful typography. If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts. And since Windows just copied the Mac, it's likely that no personal computer would have them.

If I had never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on that calligraphy class, and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do. Of course, it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college. But it was very, very clear looking backwards, ten years later.

Again, you can't connect the dots looking forward. You can only connect them looking backwards, so you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something: your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. Because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart, even when it leads you off the well-worn path. And that will make all the difference.

My second story is about love and loss. I was lucky. I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents' garage when I was 20. We worked hard, and in ten years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4,000 employees.

We just released our finest creation—the Macintosh—a year earlier, and I'd just turned 30. And then I got fired. How can you get fired from a company you started?

Well, as Apple grew, we hired someone—who I thought was very talented—to run the company with me. And for the first year or so, things went well. But then our visions of the future began to diverge. And eventually we had a falling out. When we did, our board of directors sided with him. And so at 30 I was out, and very publicly out.

What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone, and it was devastating. I really didn't know what to do for a few months. I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down, that I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me.

I met with David Packard and Bob Noyce, and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly. I was a very public failure, and I even thought about running away from the Valley.

But something slowly began to dawn on me: I still loved what I did. The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit. I'd been rejected, but I was still in love.

And so I decided to start over.

I didn't see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.

During the next five years, I started a company named NeXT, another company named Pixar, and fell in love with an amazing woman who would become my wife. Pixar went on to create the world's first computer-animated feature film, Toy Story, and is now the most successful animation studio in the world.

In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT, and I returned to Apple. And the technology we developed at NeXT is at the heart of Apple's current renaissance. And Laurene and I have a wonderful family together.

I'm pretty sure none of this would have happened if I hadn't been fired from Apple. It was awful-tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it.

Sometimes life's gonna hit you in the head with a brick. Don't lose faith.

I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did. You've got to find what you love—and that is as true for work as it is for your lovers. Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.

If you haven't found it yet, keep looking—and don't settle. As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. And like any great relationship, it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking. Don't settle.

My third story is about death. When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like, "If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you'll most certainly be right."

It made an impression on me. And since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself, "If today were the last day of my life, would I wanna do what I am about to do today?" And whenever the answer has been no for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.

Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything, all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure—these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.

Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.

About a year ago, I was diagnosed with cancer. I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning, and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas. I didn't even know what a pancreas was.

The doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable, and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months. My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order, which is doctors' code for "Prepare to die."

It means to try and tell your kids everything you thought you'd have the next ten years to tell them in just a few months. It means to make sure everything is buttoned up so that it will be as easy as possible for your family. It means to say your goodbyes.

I lived with that diagnosis all day. Later that evening I had a biopsy, where they stuck an endoscope down my throat, through my stomach, and into my intestines, put a needle into my pancreas, and got a few cells from the tumor.

I was sedated, but my wife, who was there, told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope, the doctors started crying because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery. I had the surgery, and thankfully I'm fine now.

This was the closest I've been to facing death, and I hope it's the closest I get for a few more decades. Having lived through it, I can now say this to you with a bit more certainty than when death was a useful but purely intellectual concept.

No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there. And yet, death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because death is very likely the single best invention of life. It's life's change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new.

Right now, the new is you. But someday, not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away. Sorry to be so dramatic, but it's quite true.

Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma, which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice.

And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.

When I was young, there was an amazing publication called The Whole Earth Catalog, which was one of the bibles of my generation. It was created by a fellow named Stewart Brand, not far from here in Menlo Park. And he brought it to life with his poetic touch.

This was in the late sixties, before personal computers and desktop publishing, so it was all made with typewriters, scissors, and Polaroid cameras. It was sort of like Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along. It was idealistic, overflowing with neat tools and great notions.

Stewart and his team put out several issues of The Whole Earth Catalog. And then, when it had run its course, they put out a final issue. It was the mid-1970s, and I was your age.

On the back cover of their final issue was a photograph of an early-morning country road—the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous. Beneath it were the words "Stay hungry. Stay foolish." It was their farewell message as they signed off.

"Stay hungry. Stay foolish." And I have always wished that for myself. And now, as you graduate to begin anew, I wish that for you.

Stay hungry. Stay foolish.

Thank you all very much.`

Congratulations to all of you…and especially to the magnificent Berkeley graduating class of 2016!

It is a privilege to be here at Berkeley, which has produced so many Nobel Prize winners, Turing Award winners, astronauts, members of Congress, Olympic gold medalists…. and that's just the women!

Berkeley has always been ahead of the times. In the 1960s, you led the Free Speech Movement. Back in those days, people used to say that with all the long hair, how do we even tell the boys from the girls? We now know the answer: manbuns.

Today is a day of celebration. A day to celebrate all the hard work that got you to this moment.

Today is a day of thanks. A day to thank those who helped you get here—nurtured you, taught you, cheered you on, and dried your tears.

Today is a day of reflection. Because today marks the end of one era of your life and the beginning of something new.

A commencement address is meant to be a dance between youth and wisdom. You have the youth. Someone comes in to be the voice of wisdom—that's supposed to be me. I stand up here and tell you all the things I have learned in life, you throw your cap in the air, you let your family take a million photos –don't forget to post them on Instagram —and everyone goes home happy.

Today will be a bit different. We will still do the caps and you still have to do the photos. But I am not here to tell you all the things I've learned in life. Today I will try to tell you what I learned in death.

I have never spoken publicly about this before. It's hard. But I will do my very best not to blow my nose on this beautiful Berkeley robe.

One year and thirteen days ago, I lost my husband, Dave. His death was sudden and unexpected. We were at a friend's fiftieth birthday party in Mexico. I took a nap. Dave went to work out. What followed was the unthinkable—walking into a gym to find him lying on the floor. Flying home to tell my children that their father was gone. Watching his casket being lowered into the ground.

For many months afterward, and at many times since, I was swallowed up in the deep fog of grief—what I think of as the void—an emptiness that fills your heart, your lungs, constricts your ability to think or even to breathe.

Dave's death changed me in very profound ways. I learned about the depths of sadness and the brutality of loss. But I also learned that when life sucks you under, you can kick against the bottom, break the surface, and breathe again. I learned that in the face of the void—or in the face of any challenge—you can choose joy and meaning.

I'm sharing this with you in the hopes that today, as you take the next step in your life, you can learn the lessons that I only learned in death. Lessons about hope, strength, and the light within us that will not be extinguished.

Everyone who has made it through Cal has already experienced some disappointment. You wanted an A but you got a B. OK, let's be honest—you got an A- but you're still mad. You applied for an internship at Facebook, but you only got one from Google. She was the love of your life… but then she swiped left.

You will almost certainly face more and deeper adversity. There's loss of opportunity: the job that doesn't work out, the illness or accident that changes everything in an instant. There's loss of dignity: the sharp sting of prejudice when it happens. There's loss of love: the broken relationships that can't be fixed. And sometimes there's loss of life itself.

The question is not if some of these things will happen to you. They will. Today I want to talk about what happens next. About the things you can do to overcome adversity, no matter what form it takes or when it hits you. The easy days ahead of you will be easy. It is the hard days—the times that challenge you to your very core—that will determine who you are. You will be defined not just by what you achieve, but by how you survive.

A few weeks after Dave died, I was talking to my friend Phil about a father-son activity that Dave was not here to do. We came up with a plan to fill in for Dave. I cried to him, "But I want Dave." Phil put his arm around me and said, "Option A is not available. So let's just kick the shit out of option B."

We all at some point live some form of option B. The question is: What do we do then?

As a representative of Silicon Valley, I'm pleased to tell you there is data to learn from. After spending decades studying how people deal with setbacks, psychologist Martin Seligman found that there are three P's—personalization, pervasiveness, and permanence—that are critical to how we bounce back from hardship. The seeds of resilience are planted in the way we process the negative events in our lives.

The first P is personalization—the belief that we are at fault. This is different from taking responsibility, which you should always do. This is the lesson that not everything that happens to us happens because of us.

When Dave died, I had a very common reaction, which was to blame myself. He died in seconds from a cardiac arrhythmia. I poured over his medical records asking what I could have—or should have—done. It wasn't until I learned about the three P's that I accepted that I could not have prevented his death. His doctors had not identified his coronary artery disease. I was an economics major; how could I have?

The second P is pervasiveness—the belief that an event will affect all areas of your life. You know that song "Everything is awesome?" This is the flip: "Everything is awful." There's no place to run or hide from the all-consuming sadness.

The child psychologists I spoke to encouraged me to get my kids back to their routine as soon as possible. So ten days after Dave died, they went back to school and I went back to work. I remember sitting in my first Facebook meeting in a deep, deep haze. All I could think was, "What is everyone talking about and how could this possibly matter?" But then I got drawn into the discussion and for a second—a brief split second—I forgot about death.

That brief second helped me see that there were other things in my life that were not awful. My children and I were healthy. My friends and family were so loving and they carried us—quite literally at times.

The third P is permanence—the belief that the sorrow will last forever. For months, no matter what I did, it felt like the crushing grief would always be there.

We often project our current feelings out indefinitely—and experience what I think of as the second derivative of those feelings. We feel anxious—and then we feel anxious that we're anxious. We feel sad—and then we feel sad that we're sad. Instead, we should accept our feelings—but recognize that they will not last forever.

But I wish I had known about the three P's when I was your age. There were so many times these lessons would have helped.

The three P's are common emotional reactions to so many things that happen to us—in our careers, our personal lives, and our relationships. You're probably feeling one of them right now about something in your life. But if you can recognize you are falling into these traps, you can catch yourself. Just as our bodies have a physiological immune system, our brains have a psychological immune system—and there are steps you can take to help kick it into gear.

One day my friend Adam Grant, a psychologist, suggested that I think about how much worse things could be. This was completely counterintuitive; it seemed like the way to recover was to try to find positive thoughts. "Worse?" I said. "Are you kidding me? How could things be worse?" His answer cut straight through me: "Dave could have had that same cardiac arrhythmia while he was driving your children." Wow. The moment he said it, I was overwhelmingly grateful that the rest of my family was alive and healthy. That gratitude overtook some of the grief.

Finding gratitude and appreciation is key to resilience. People who take the time to list things they are grateful for are happier and healthier. It turns out that counting your blessings can actually increase your blessings.

As you graduate, can you ask yourselves to live as if you had eleven days left? I don't mean blow everything off and party all the time— although tonight is an exception. I mean live with the understanding of how precious every single day would be. How precious every day actually is.

As I stand here today, a year after the worst day of my life, two things are true. I have a huge reservoir of sadness that is with me always—right here where I can touch it. I never knew I could cry so often—or so much.

But I am also aware that I am walking without pain. For the first time, I am grateful for each breath in and out—grateful for the gift of life itself. I used to celebrate my birthday every five years and friends' birthdays sometimes. Now I celebrate always. I used to go to sleep worrying about all the things I messed up that day—and trust me that list was often quite long. Now I try really hard to focus on each day's moments of joy.

It is the greatest irony of my life that losing my husband helped me find deeper gratitude—gratitude for the kindness of my friends, the love of my family, the laughter of my children. My hope for you is that you can find that gratitude—not just on the good days, like today, but on the hard ones, when you will really need it.

There are so many moments of joy ahead of you. That trip you always wanted to take. A first kiss with someone you really like. The day you get a job doing something you truly believe in. All of these things will happen to you. Enjoy each and every one.

I hope that you live your life—each precious day of it—with joy and meaning. I hope that you walk without pain—and that you are grateful for each step.

And when the challenges come, I hope you remember that anchored deep within you is the ability to learn and grow. You are not born with a fixed amount of resilience. Like a muscle, you can build it up, draw on it when you need it. In that process you will figure out who you really are—and you just might become the very best version of yourself.

Class of 2016, as you leave Berkeley, build resilience.

Build resilience in yourselves. When tragedy or disappointment strike, know that you have the ability to get through absolutely anything. I promise you do. As the saying goes, we are more vulnerable than we ever thought, but we are stronger than we ever imagined.

Build resilient organizations. If anyone can do it, you can, because Berkeley is filled with people who want to make the world a better place. Never stop working to do so—whether it's a boardroom that is not representative or a campus that's not safe. Speak up, especially at institutions like this one, which you hold so dear.

Build resilient communities. We find our humanity—our will to live and our ability to love—in our connections to one another. Be there for your family and friends. And I mean in person. Not just in a message with a heart emoji.

Lift each other up, help each other kick the shit out of option B—and celebrate each and every moment of joy.

You have the whole world in front of you. I can't wait to see what you do with it.

Congratulations, and Go Bears!`

Thank you. Congratulations class of '17. I especially want to thank Chairman Millard, President Reif, distinguished faculty, trustees, and the members of the class of 1967. It is a privilege to be here today with your families and your friends on such on amazing and important day.

MIT and Apple share so much. We both love hard problems. We love the search for new ideas, and we especially love finding those ideas, the really big ones, the ones that can change the world. I know MIT has a proud tradition of pranks or as you would call them, hacks. And you have have pulled off some pretty great ones over the years. I'll never figure out how MIT students sent that Mars rover to the Kresge Oval, or put a propeller beanie on the great dome, or how you've obviously taken over the president's Twitter account. I can tell college students are behind because most of the Tweets happen at 3:00 a.m.

I'm really happy to be here. Today is about celebration. And you have so much to be proud of. As you leave here to start the next leg of your journey in life, there will be days where you ask yourself, 'Where is this all going?' 'What is the purpose?' 'What is my purpose?' I will be honest, I asked myself that same question and it took nearly 15 years to answer it. Maybe by talking about my journey today, I can save you some time.

The struggle for me started early on. In high school, I thought I discovered my life's purpose when I could answer that age-old question, 'What do you want to be when you grow up?' Nope. In college I thought I'd discover it when I could answer, 'What's your major?' Not quite. I thought that maybe I'd discovered it when I found a good job. Then I thought I just needed to get a few promotions. That didn't work either.

I kept convincing myself that it was just over the horizon, around the next corner. Nothing worked. And it was really tearing me apart. Part of me kept pushing ahead to the next achievement. And the other part kept asking, 'Is this all there is?' I went to grad school at Duke looking for the answer. I tried meditation. I sought guidance in religion. I read great philosophers and authors. And in a moment of youthful indiscretion, I might even have experimented with a Windows PC, and obviously that didn't work.

After countless twists and turns, at last, 20 years ago, my search brought me to Apple. At the time, the company was struggling to survive. Steve Jobs had just returned to Apple, and had launched the 'Think Different' campaign. He wanted to empower the crazy ones—the misfits, the rebels and the troublemakers, the round pegs, and the square holes—to do the best work. If we could just do that, Steve knew we could really change the world.

Before that moment, I had never met a leader with such passion or encountered a company with such a clear and compelling purpose: to serve humanity. It was just that simple. Serve humanity. And it was in that moment, after 15 years of searching, something clicked. I finally felt aligned. Aligned with a company that brought together challenging, cutting edge work with a higher purpose. Aligned with a leader who believed that technology which didn't exist yet could reinvent tomorrow's world. Aligned with myself and my own deep need to serve something greater.

Of course, at that moment I don't know all of that. I was just grateful to have psychological burden lifted. But with the help of hindsight, my breakthrough makes a lot more sense. I was never going to find my purpose working some place without a clear sense of purpose of its own. Steve and Apple freed me to throw my whole self into my work, to embrace their mission and make it my own. How can I serve humanity? This is life's biggest and most important question. When you work towards something greater than yourself, you find meaning, you find purpose. So the question I hope you will carry forward from here is how will you serve humanity?

The good news is since you are here today you are on a great track. At MIT you have learned how much power that science and technology have to change the world for the better. Thanks to discoveries made right here, billions of people are leading healthier, more productive and more fulfilling lives. And if we're ever going to solve some of the hardest problems facing the world today, everything from cancer to climate change to educational inequality, then technology will help us to do it. But technology alone isn't the solution. And sometimes it's even part of the problem.

Last year I had the chance to meet with Pope Francis. It was the most incredible meeting of my life. This is a man who has spent more time comforting the inflicted in slums than with heads of state. This may surprise you, but he knew an unbelievable amount about technology. It was obvious to me that he had thought deeply about it. Its opportunity. Its risks. Its morality. What he said to me at that meeting, what he preached, really, was on a topic that we care a lot about at Apple. But he expressed a shared concern in a powerful new way: Never has humanity had such power over itself, yet nothing ensures it will be used wisely, he has said.

Technology today is integral to almost all aspects of our lives and most of the time it's a force for good. And yet the potential adverse consequences are spreading faster and cutting deeper. The threats to security, threats to privacy, fake news, and social media that becomes antisocial. Sometimes the very technology that is meant to connect us divides us. Technology is capable of doing great things. But it doesn't want to do great things. It doesn't want anything. That part takes all of us. It takes our values and our commitment to our families and our neighbors and our communities, our love of beauty and belief that all of our faiths are interconnected, our decency, our kindness.

I'm not worried about artificial intelligence giving computers the ability to think like humans. I'm more concerned about people thinking like computers without values or compassion, without concern for consequences. That is what we need you to help us guard against. Because if science is a search in the darkness, then the humanities are a candle that shows us where we've been and the danger that lies ahead.

As Steve once said, technology alone is not enough. It is technology married with the liberal arts married with the humanities that make our hearts sing. When you keep people at the center of what you do, it can have an enormous impact. It means an iPhone that allows the blind person to run a marathon. It means an Apple Watch that catches a heart condition before it becomes a heart attack. It means an iPad that helps a child with autism connect with his or her world. In short, it means technology infused with your values, making progress possible for everyone.

Whatever you do in your life, and whatever we do at Apple, we must infuse it with the humanity that each of us is born with. That responsibility is immense, but so is the opportunity. I'm optimistic because I believe in your generation, your passion, your journey to serve humanity. We are all counting on you. There is so much out there conspiring to make you cynical. The internet has enabled so much and empowered so many, but it can also be a place where basic rules of decency are suspended and pettiness and negativity thrive.

Don't let that noise knock you off course. Don't get caught up in the trivial aspects of life. Don't listen to trolls and for God's sake don't become one. Measure your impact in humanity not in the likes, but the lives you touch; not in popularity, but in the people you serve. I found that my life got bigger when I stopped carrying about what other people thought about me. You will find yours will too. Stay focused on what really matters. There will be times when your resolve to serve humanity will be tested. Be prepared. People will try to convince you that you should keep your empathy out of your career. Don't accept this false premise.

At a shareholders meeting a few years back, someone questioned Apple's investment and focus on the environment. He asked me to pledge that Apple would only invest in green initiatives that could be justified with a return on investment. I tried to be diplomatic. I pointed out that Apple does many things, like accessibility features for those with disabilities that don't rely on an ROI. We do the things because they are the right thing to do, and protecting the environment is a critical example. He wouldn't let it go and I got my blood up. So I told him, "If you can't accept our position, you shouldn't own Apple stock."

When you are convinced that your cause is right, have the courage to take a stand. If you see a problem or an injustice, recognize that no one will fix it but you. As you go forward today, use your minds and hands and your hearts to build something bigger than yourselves. Always remember there is no idea bigger than this. As Dr. Martin Luther King said, "All life is interrelated. We are all bound together into a single garment of destiny." If you keep that idea at the forefront of all that you do, if you choose to live your lives at that intersection between technology and the people it serves, if you strive to create the best, give the best, do the best for everyone, not just for some, then today all of humanity has good cause for hope.

Thank you very much and congratulations class of 2017!`

    fullText: `President Bok, former President Rudenstine, incoming President Faust, members of the Harvard Corporation and the Board of Overseers, members of the faculty, parents, and especially, the graduates:

I've been waiting more than 30 years to say this: "Dad, I always told you I'd come back and get my degree."

I want to thank Harvard for this timely honor. I'll be changing my job next year … and it will be nice to finally have a college degree on my resume.

I applaud the graduates today for taking a much more direct route to your degrees. For my part, I'm just happy that the Crimson has called me "Harvard's most successful dropout." I guess that makes me valedictorian of my own special class … I did the best of everyone who failed.

Harvard was just a phenomenal experience for me. Academic life was fascinating. I used to sit in on lots of classes I hadn't even signed up for. And dorm life was terrific. I lived up at Radcliffe, in Currier House. There were always lots of people in my dorm room late at night discussing things, because everyone knew I didn't worry about getting up in the morning.

One of my biggest memories of Harvard came in January 1975, when I made a call from Currier House to a company in Albuquerque that had begun making the world's first personal computers. I offered to sell them software.

I worried that they would realize I was just a student in a dorm and hang up on me. Instead they said: "We're not quite ready, come see us in a month," which was a good thing, because we hadn't written the software yet. From that moment, I worked day and night on this little extra credit project that marked the end of my college education and the beginning of a remarkable journey with Microsoft.

What I remember above all about Harvard was being in the midst of so much energy and intelligence. It could be exhilarating, intimidating, sometimes even discouraging, but always challenging. It was an amazing privilege – and though I left early, I was transformed by my years at Harvard, the friendships I made, and the ideas I worked on.

But taking a serious look back … I do have one big regret.

I left Harvard with no real awareness of the awful inequities in the world – the appalling disparities of health, and wealth, and opportunity that condemn millions of people to lives of despair.

I learned a lot here at Harvard about new ideas in economics and politics. I got great exposure to the advances being made in the sciences.

But humanity's greatest advances are not in its discoveries – but in how those discoveries are applied to reduce inequity. Whether through democracy, strong public education, quality health care, or broad economic opportunity – reducing inequity is the highest human achievement.

I left campus knowing little about the millions of young people cheated out of educational opportunities here in this country. And I knew nothing about the millions of people living in unspeakable poverty and disease in developing countries.

It took me decades to find out.

You graduates came to Harvard at a different time. You know more about the world's inequities than the classes that came before. In your years here, I hope you've had a chance to think about how – in this age of accelerating technology – we can finally take on these inequities, and we can solve them.

For Melinda and for me, the challenge is the same: how can we do the most good for the greatest number with the resources we have.

During our discussions on this question, Melinda and I read an article about the millions of children who were dying every year in poor countries from diseases that we had long ago made harmless in this country. Measles, malaria, pneumonia, hepatitis B, yellow fever. One disease I had never even heard of, rotavirus, was killing half a million kids each year – none of them in the United States.

We were shocked. We had just assumed that if millions of children were dying and they could be saved, the world would make it a priority to discover and deliver the medicines to save them. But it did not. For under a dollar, there were interventions that could save lives that just weren't being delivered.

If you believe that every life has equal value, it's revolting to learn that some lives are seen as worth saving and others are not. We said to ourselves: "This can't be true. But if it is true, it deserves to be the priority of our giving."

So we began our work in the same way anyone here would begin it. We asked: "How could the world let these children die?"

The answer is simple, and harsh. The market did not reward saving the lives of these children, and governments did not subsidize it. So the children died because their mothers and their fathers had no power in the market and no voice in the system.

But you and I have both.

We can make market forces work better for the poor if we can develop a more creative capitalism – if we can stretch the reach of market forces so that more people can make a profit, or at least make a living, serving people who are suffering from the worst inequities. We also can press governments around the world to spend taxpayer money in ways that better reflect the values of the people who pay the taxes.

If we can find approaches that meet the needs of the poor in ways that generate profits for business and votes for politicians, we will have found a sustainable way to reduce inequity in the world. This task is open-ended. It can never be finished. But a conscious effort to answer this challenge will change the world.

I am optimistic that we can do this, but I talk to skeptics who claim there is no hope. They say: "Inequity has been with us since the beginning, and will be with us till the end – because people just … don't … care." I completely disagree.

I believe we have more caring than we know what to do with.

All of us here in this Yard, at one time or another, have seen human tragedies that broke our hearts, and yet we did nothing – not because we didn't care, but because we didn't know what to do. If we had known how to help, we would have acted.

The barrier to change is not too little caring; it is too much complexity.

To turn caring into action, we need to see a problem, see a solution, and see the impact. But complexity blocks all three steps.

If we can really see a problem, which is the first step, we come to the second step: cutting through the complexity to find a solution.

Finding solutions is essential if we want to make the most of our caring. If we have clear and proven answers anytime an organization or individual asks "How can I help?," then we can get action – and we can make sure that none of the caring in the world is wasted.

Cutting through complexity to find a solution runs through four predictable stages: determine a goal, find the highest-leverage approach, discover the ideal technology for that approach, and in the meantime, make the smartest application of the technology that you already have — whether it's something sophisticated, like a drug, or something simpler, like a bednet.

The final step – after seeing the problem and finding an approach – is to measure the impact of your work and share your successes and failures so that others learn from your efforts.

You have to have the statistics, of course. You have to be able to show that a program is vaccinating millions more children. You have to be able to show a decline in the number of children dying from these diseases. This is essential not just to improve the program, but also to help draw more investment from business and government.

But if you want to inspire people to participate, you have to show more than numbers; you have to convey the human impact of the work – so people can feel what saving a life means to the families affected.

Still, I'm optimistic. Yes, inequity has been with us forever, but the new tools we have to cut through complexity have not been with us forever. They are new – they can help us make the most of our caring – and that's why the future can be different from the past.

The defining and ongoing innovations of this age – biotechnology, the computer, the Internet – give us a chance we've never had before to end extreme poverty and end death from preventable disease.

Members of the Harvard Family: Here in the Yard is one of the great collections of intellectual talent in the world.

What for?

There is no question that the faculty, the alumni, the students, and the benefactors of Harvard have used their power to improve the lives of people here and around the world. But can we do more? Can Harvard dedicate its intellect to improving the lives of people who will never even hear its name?

Let me make a request of the deans and the professors – the intellectual leaders here at Harvard: As you hire new faculty, award tenure, review curriculum, and determine degree requirements, please ask yourselves:

Should our best minds be dedicated to solving our biggest problems?

Should Harvard encourage its faculty to take on the world's worst inequities? Should Harvard students learn about the depth of global poverty … the prevalence of world hunger … the scarcity of clean water …the girls kept out of school … the children who die from diseases we can cure?

Should the world's most privileged people learn about the lives of the world's least privileged?

These are not rhetorical questions – you will answer with your policies.

My mother, who was filled with pride the day I was admitted here – never stopped pressing me to do more for others. A few days before my wedding, she hosted a bridal event, at which she read aloud a letter about marriage that she had written to Melinda. My mother was very ill with cancer at the time, but she saw one more opportunity to deliver her message, and at the close of the letter she said: "From those to whom much is given, much is expected."

When you consider what those of us here in this Yard have been given – in talent, privilege, and opportunity – there is almost no limit to what the world has a right to expect from us.

In line with the promise of this age, I want to exhort each of the graduates here to take on an issue – a complex problem, a deep inequity, and become a specialist on it. If you make it the focus of your career, that would be phenomenal. But you don't have to do that to make an impact. For a few hours every week, you can use the growing power of the Internet to get informed, find others with the same interests, see the barriers, and find ways to cut through them.

Don't let complexity stop you. Be activists. Take on the big inequities. It will be one of the great experiences of your lives.

You graduates are coming of age in an amazing time. As you leave Harvard, you have technology that members of my class never had. You have awareness of global inequity, which we did not have. And with that awareness, you likely also have an informed conscience that will torment you if you abandon these people whose lives you could change with very little effort. You have more than we had; you must start sooner, and carry on longer.

Knowing what you know, how could you not?

And I hope you will come back here to Harvard 30 years from now and reflect on what you have done with your talent and your energy. I hope you will judge yourselves not on your professional accomplishments alone, but also on how well you have addressed the world's deepest inequities … on how well you treated people a world away who have nothing in common with you but their humanity.

Good luck.`

    fullText: `President Faust, members of the Harvard Corporation and the Board of Overseers, members of the faculty, proud parents, and, above all, graduates.

The first thing I would like to say is 'thank you.' Not only has Harvard given me an extraordinary honour, but the weeks of fear and nausea I have endured at the thought of giving this commencement address have made me lose weight. A win-win situation! Now all I have to do is take deep breaths, squint at the red banners and convince myself that I am at the world's largest Gryffindor reunion.

Delivering a commencement address is a great responsibility; or so I thought until I cast my mind back to my own graduation. The commencement speaker that day was the distinguished British philosopher Baroness Mary Warnock. Reflecting on her speech has helped me enormously in writing this one, because it turns out that I can't remember a single word she said. This liberating discovery enables me to proceed without any fear that I might inadvertently influence you to abandon promising careers in business, the law or politics for the giddy delights of becoming a gay wizard.

Actually, I have wracked my mind and heart for what I ought to say to you today. I have asked myself what I wish I had known at my own graduation, and what important lessons I have learned in the 21 years that have expired between that day and this.

I have come up with two answers. On this wonderful day when we are gathered together to celebrate your academic success, I have decided to talk to you about the benefits of failure. And as you stand on the threshold of what is sometimes called 'real life', I want to extol the crucial importance of imagination.

Looking back at the 21-year-old that I was at graduation, is a slightly uncomfortable experience for the 42-year-old that she has become. Half my lifetime ago, I was striking an uneasy balance between the ambition I had for myself, and what those closest to me expected of me.

I was convinced that the only thing I wanted to do, ever, was to write novels. However, my parents, both of whom came from impoverished backgrounds and neither of whom had been to college, took the view that my overactive imagination was an amusing personal quirk that would never pay a mortgage, or secure a pension.

What I feared most for myself at your age was not poverty, but failure.

At your age, in spite of a distinct lack of motivation at university, where I had spent far too long in the coffee bar writing stories, and far too little time at lectures, I had a knack for passing examinations, and that, for years, had been the measure of success in my life and that of my peers.

However, the fact that you are graduating from Harvard suggests that you are not very well-acquainted with failure. You might be driven by a fear of failure quite as much as a desire for success. Indeed, your conception of failure might not be too far from the average person's idea of success, so high have you already flown.

Ultimately, we all have to decide for ourselves what constitutes failure, but the world is quite eager to give you a set of criteria if you let it. So I think it fair to say that by any conventional measure, a mere seven years after my graduation day, I had failed on an epic scale. An exceptionally short-lived marriage had imploded, and I was jobless, a lone parent, and as poor as it is possible to be in modern Britain, without being homeless.

Now, I am not going to stand here and tell you that failure is fun. That period of my life was a dark one, and I had no idea that there was going to be what the press has since represented as a kind of fairy tale resolution.

So why do I talk about the benefits of failure? Simply because failure meant a stripping away of the inessential. I stopped pretending to myself that I was anything other than what I was, and began to direct all my energy into finishing the only work that mattered to me. Had I really succeeded at anything else, I might never have found the determination to succeed in the one arena I believed I truly belonged. I was set free, because my greatest fear had been realised, and I was still alive, and I still had a daughter whom I adored, and I had an old typewriter and a big idea. And so rock bottom became the solid foundation on which I rebuilt my life.

You might never fail on the scale I did, but some failure in life is inevitable. It is impossible to live without failing at something, unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all – in which case, you fail by default.

Failure gave me an inner security that I had never attained by passing examinations. Failure taught me things about myself that I could have learned no other way. I discovered that I had a strong will, and more discipline than I had suspected; I also found out that I had friends whose value was truly above the price of rubies.

The knowledge that you have emerged wiser and stronger from setbacks means that you are, ever after, secure in your ability to survive. You will never truly know yourself, or the strength of your relationships, until both have been tested by adversity.

Now you might think that I chose my second theme, the importance of imagination, because of the part it played in rebuilding my life, but that is not wholly so. Imagination is not only the uniquely human capacity to envision that which is not, and therefore the fount of all invention and innovation. In its arguably most transformative and revelatory capacity, it is the power that enables us to empathise with humans whose experiences we have never shared.

One of the greatest formative experiences of my life preceded Harry Potter, though it informed much of what I subsequently wrote in those books. This revelation came in the form of one of my earliest day jobs. Though I was sloping off to write stories during my lunch hours, I paid the rent in my early 20s by working at the African research department at Amnesty International's headquarters in London.

There in my little office I read hastily scribbled letters smuggled out of totalitarian regimes by men and women who were risking imprisonment to inform the outside world of what was happening to them. I saw photographs of those who had disappeared without trace, sent to Amnesty by their desperate families and friends.

Every day of my working week in my early 20s I was reminded how incredibly fortunate I was, to live in a country with a democratically elected government, where legal representation and a public trial were the rights of everyone.

And yet I also learned more about human goodness at Amnesty International than I had ever known before.

Amnesty mobilises thousands of people who have never been tortured or imprisoned for their beliefs to act on behalf of those who have. The power of human empathy, leading to collective action, saves lives, and frees prisoners. Ordinary people, whose personal well-being and security are assured, join together in huge numbers to save people they do not know, and will never meet.

Unlike any other creature on this planet, humans can learn and understand, without having experienced. They can think themselves into other people's places.

Of course, this is a power, like my brand of fictional magic, that is morally neutral. One might use such an ability to manipulate, or control, just as much as to understand or sympathise.

And many prefer not to exercise their imaginations at all. They choose to remain comfortably within the bounds of their own experience, never troubling to wonder how it would feel to have been born other than they are.

What is more, those who choose not to empathise enable real monsters. For without ever committing an act of outright evil ourselves, we collude with it, through our own apathy.

One of the many things I learned at the end of that Classics corridor down which I ventured at the age of 18, in search of something I could not then define, was this, written by the Greek author Plutarch: What we achieve inwardly will change outer reality.

But how much more are you, Harvard graduates of 2008, likely to touch other people's lives? Your intelligence, your capacity for hard work, the education you have earned and received, give you unique status, and unique responsibilities.

If you choose to use your status and influence to raise your voice on behalf of those who have no voice; if you choose to identify not only with the powerful, but with the powerless; if you retain the ability to imagine yourself into the lives of those who do not have your advantages, then it will not only be your proud families who celebrate your existence, but thousands and millions of people whose reality you have helped change. We do not need magic to change the world, we carry all the power we need inside ourselves already: we have the power to imagine better.

I am nearly finished. I have one last hope for you, which is something that I already had at 21. The friends with whom I sat on graduation day have been my friends for life.

So today, I wish you nothing better than similar friendships. And tomorrow, I hope that even if you remember not a single word of mine, you remember those of Seneca, another of those old Romans I met when I fled down the Classics corridor, in retreat from career ladders, in search of ancient wisdom:

As is a tale, so is life: not how long it is, but how good it is, is what matters.

I wish you all very good lives. Thank-you very much.`

President Gutmann, Provost Price, Board Chair Cohen, fellow honorees, beautiful honorees, and today's graduates. I'm honored and grateful for the invitation today. It's always been great to be on the Penn campus. I've been here before a lot of times for basketball games. My son played on the basketball team.

But I'll be honest with you. I'm a little nervous. I'm not used to speaking at a graduation of this magnitude. It's a little overwhelming. It's out of my comfort zone. You dress me up in army fatigues or throw me on top of a moving train that someone said unstoppable, or ask me to play Malcolm X, Rubin Hurricane Carter, or Alonzo from Training Day, I can do that. But a commencement speech, it's a very serious affair, and it's a very different ball game.

I was thinking about this speech, what I should say. I figured the best way to keep your attention would be to talk about something, really juicy Hollywood stuff. But I said, no, no, no. You're a group of high-minded intellectuals.

So I was back to square one, feeling the pressure. So, now you're probably thinking if it was going to be this difficult, this is much pressure, why did I even accept today's invitation in the first place? Well, my son goes here, that's number one. That's a good reason. And I always like to check to see how my money's being spent.

So I had to be here. I had to come, even though I was afraid I might make a fool of myself. In fact, if you really want to know the truth, I had to come exactly because I might make a fool of myself. Now, what am I talking about? Here it is.

I found that nothing in life is worthwhile unless you take risks. Nothing. Nelson Mandela said, "There is no passion to be found, playing small and settling for a life that's less than the one you're capable of living."

Now, I'm sure in your experiences in school and applying to college and picking your major and deciding what you want to do with life, I'm sure people have told you to make sure you have something to fall back on. Make sure you got something to fall back on, honey. But I never understood that concept, having something to fall back on. If I'm going to fall, I don't want to fall back on anything except my faith. I want to fall forward. I figure at least this way, I'll see what I'm going to hit.

Fall forward. This is what I mean. Reggie Jackson struck out 2,600 times in his career, the most in the history of baseball, but you don't hear about the strikeouts. People remember the home runs. Fall forward.

Thomas Edison conducted 1000 failed experiments. Did you know that? I didn't know that. Because the 1001st was the light bulb. Fall forward.

Every failed experiment is one step closer to success. You've got to take risks, and I'm sure you've probably heard that before, but I want to talk to you about why that's so important. I got three reasons.

First, you will fail at some point in your life. Accept it. You will lose. You will embarrass yourself. You will suck at something. There's no doubt about it. And I know that's probably not a traditional message for a graduation ceremony, but hey, I'm telling you embrace it because it's inevitable. And I should know. In the acting business, you fail all the time.

Early on in my career, I auditioned for a part in a Broadway musical. Perfect role for me, I thought, except for the fact that I can't sing. So, I'm in the wings. I'm about to go on stage, but the guy in front of me, he's singing like Pavarotti. And I'm just shrinking. I'm getting smaller and smaller.

I didn't get the job. But here's the thing. I didn't quit. I didn't fall back. I walked out of there to prepare for the next audition and the next audition and the next audition. I prayed. I prayed and I prayed. But I continued to fail and fail and fail. But it didn't matter because you know what? There's an old saying, you hang around the barbershop long enough, sooner or later, you're going to get a haircut. So you will catch a break. And I did catch a break.

Last year, I did a play called Fences on Broadway. Won the Tony Award. And I didn't have to sing, by the way. But here's the kicker. It was at the Cort Theatre. It was at the same theater that I failed that first audition, 30 years prior.

The point is, every graduate here today has the training and the talent to succeed. But do you have the guts to fail?

Here's my second point about failure. If you don't fail, you're not even trying. I'll say it again. If you don't fail, you're not even trying. My wife told me this great expression. To get something you never had, you have to do something you never did.

So I ask you today, how many ghosts are going to be around your bed when your time comes? You've invested a lot in your education, and people have invested in you. And let me tell you, the world needs your talents. Man, does it ever. The world needs a lot, and we need it from you. We really do. We need it from you young people.

So you got to get out there. You got to give it everything you got, whether it's your time, your talent, your prayers, or your treasures. Because remember this, you will never see a U-Haul behind a hearse. I'll say it again. You will never see a U-Haul behind a hearse. You can't take it with you. The Egyptians tried it, and all they got was robbed.

So the question is, what are you going to do with what you have? I'm not talking about how much you have. Some of you are business majors. Some of you were theologians, nurses, sociologists. Some of you have money. Some of you have patience. Some of you have kindness. Some of you have love. Some of you have the gift of long-suffering. Whatever it is, whatever your gift is, what are you going to do with what you have?

All right. Now, here's my last point about failure. Sometimes it's the best way to figure out where you're going. Your life will never be a straight path. I began at Fordham University as a pre-med student. I took a course called cardiac morphogenesis. I couldn't read it. I couldn't say it. I sure couldn't pass it.

So then I decided to go into pre-law, then journalism. And with no academic focus, my grades took off in their own direction. Yeah, down. I was a 1.8 GPA one semester. And the university very politely suggested that it might be better to take some time off. I was 20 years old. I was at my lowest point.

And then one day, and I remember the exact day, March 27, 1975, I was helping my mother in her beauty shop. My mother owned a beauty shop up in Mount Vernon. And there was this older woman who was considered one of the elders in the town. And I didn't know her personally, but I was looking in a mirror and every time I looked at the mirror, I could see her behind me. And she was staring at me.

So she finally took the dryer off her head, and she said something I'll never forget. First of all, she said, "Somebody give me a piece of paper. Give me a piece of paper." She said, "Young boy, I have a prophecy, a spiritual prophecy." She said, "You are going to travel the world and speak to millions of people."

Now mind you, I'm 20 years old. I'm flunked out of school. But maybe she was onto something. Because later that summer, while working as a counselor to YMCA camp in Connecticut, we put on a talent show for the campus. And after the show, another counselor that came up to me and asked, "Had you ever thought about acting? You're good at that."

So when I got back to Fordham that fall, I got in and I changed my major once again, for the last time. And in the years that followed, just as that woman prophesied, I have traveled the world, and I have spoken to millions of people through my movies. But I see you today. And I'm encouraged by what I see. And I'm strengthened by what I see. And I love what I see.

So members of the class of 2011, this is your mission. When you leave the friendly confines of Philly, never be discouraged, never hold back, give everything you got. And when you fall throughout life, remember this: fall forward.

Congratulations. I love you. God bless you. I respect you.`

Then I went to look up what commencement meant, which would have been easy if I had a dictionary, but most of the books in our house are Portia's, and they're all written in Australian. So I had to break the word down myself, to find out the meaning.

I thought that you had to be a famous alumnus, alumini, aluminum, alumis; you had to graduate from this school. And I didn't go to college here, and I don't know if President Cowan knows, I didn't go to any college at all, any college. And I'm not saying you wasted your time, or money, but look at me, I'm a huge celebrity.

Although I did graduate from the school of hard knocks, our mascot was the knockers. I spent a lot of time here growing up. My mom worked at Newcomb and I would go there every time I needed to steal something out of her purse.

But why am I here today? Clearly not to steal, you're too far away and I'd never get away with it. I'm here because of you. Because I can't think of a more tenacious, more courageous graduating class. I mean, look at you all, wearing your robes. Usually when you're wearing a robe at 10 in the morning, it means you've given up.

I'm here because I love New Orleans. I was born and raised here, I spent my formative years here, and like you, while I was living here I only did laundry six times. When I finished school, I was completely lost and by school, I mean middle school, but I went ahead and finished high school anyway. And I really, I had no ambition; I didn't know what I wanted to do. I did everything from: I shucked oysters, I was a hostess, I was a bartender, I was a waitress, I painted houses, I sold vacuum cleaners; I had no idea and I thought I'd just finally settle in some job and I would make enough money to pay my rent, maybe have basic cable, maybe not, I didn't really have a plan.

My point is that, by the time I was your age, I really thought I knew who I was but I had no idea. Like for example, when I was your age, I was dating men. So what I'm saying is, when you're older, most of you will be gay. Is anybody writing this stuff down? Parents?

Anyway, I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and the way I ended up on this path was from a very tragic event. I was maybe 19, and my girlfriend at the time was killed in a car accident. And I passed the accident, and I didn't know it was her and I kept going and I found out shortly after that, it was her.

And I was living in a basement apartment; I had no money; I had no heat, no air, I had a mattress on the floor and the apartment was infested with fleas. And I was soul-searching, I was like, why is she suddenly gone, and there are fleas here? I don't understand, there must be a purpose and wouldn't it be so convenient if we could pick up the phone and call God and ask these questions.

And I started writing and what poured out of me was an imaginary conversation with God, which was one-sided and I finished writing it and I looked at it and I said to myself, and I hadn't even been doing stand-up, ever, there was no club in town. I said, "I'm going do this on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson" – at the time he was the king – "and I'm going be the first woman in the history of the show to be called over to sit down." And several years later, I was the first woman in the history of the show, and only woman in the history of the show to sit down, because of that phone conversation with God that I wrote.

And I started this path of stand-up, and it was successful and it was great, but it was hard because I was trying to please everybody and I had this secret that I was keeping, that I was gay. And I thought if people found out they wouldn't like me, they wouldn't laugh at me. Then my career turned… I got my own sitcom, and that was very successful, another level of success. And I thought, what if they find out I'm gay, then they'll never watch, and this was a long time ago, this was when we just had white presidents. But anyway, this was back many years ago.

And I finally decided that I was living with so much shame, and so much fear, that I just couldn't live that way anymore and I decided to come out and make it creative. And my character would come out at the same time, and it wasn't to make a political statement, it wasn't to do anything other than to free myself up from this heaviness that I was carrying around, and I just wanted to be honest. And I thought, "What's the worst that could happen? I can lose my career." I did. I lost my career. The show was cancelled after six years without even telling me; I read it in the paper. The phone didn't ring for three years. I had no offers. Nobody wanted to touch me at all.

Yet, I was getting letters from kids that almost committed suicide, but didn't because of what I did. And I realized that I had a purpose. And it wasn't just about me and it wasn't about celebrity, but I felt like I was being punished and it was a bad time, I was angry, I was sad, and then I was offered a talk show. And the people that offered me the talk show tried to sell it. And most stations didn't want to pick it up. Most people didn't want to buy it because they thought nobody would watch me.

Really when I look back on it, I wouldn't change a thing. I mean, it was so important for me to lose everything because I found out what the most important thing is, is to be true to yourself. Ultimately, that's what's gotten me to this place. I don't live in fear, I'm free; I have no secrets and I know I'll always be OK, because no matter what, I know who I am.

So in conclusion, when I was younger I thought success was something different. I thought when I grow up, I want to be famous. I want to be a star. I want to be in movies. When I grow up I want to see the world, drive nice cars, I want to have groupies. To quote the Pussycat Dolls. How many people thought it was "boobies", by the way? It's not, it's "groupies".

But my idea of success is different today. And as you grow, you'll realize the definition of success changes. For many of you, today, success is being able to hold down 20 shots of tequila. For me, the most important thing in your life is to live your life with integrity and not to give into peer pressure to try to be something that you're not, to live your life as an honest and compassionate person, to contribute in some way. So to conclude my conclusion, follow your passion, stay true to yourself. Never follow anyone else's path, unless you're in the woods and you're lost and you see a path and by all means you should follow that.

Don't give advice, it will come back and bite you in the ass. Don't take anyone's advice. So my advice to you is to be true to yourself and everything will be fine. And I know that a lot of you are concerned about your future, but there's no need to worry. The economy is booming, the job market is wide open, the planet is just fine. It's going be great.

You've already survived a hurricane. What else can happen to you? And as I mentioned before, some of the most devastating things that happen to you will teach you the most. And now you know the right questions to ask in your first job interview. Like, "Is it above sea level?"

So to conclude my conclusion that I've previously concluded, in the common cement speech, I guess what I'm trying to say is life is like one big Mardi Gras. But instead of showing your boobs, show people your brain, and if they like what they see, you'll have more beads than you know what to do with and you'll be drunk, most of the time.

So the Katrina class of 2009, I say congratulations, and if you don't remember a thing I said today, remember this, you're going to be OK, dum de dumdumdum, just dance.`

    fullText: `Before I begin, I must point out that behind me sits a highly admired President of the United States and decorated war hero while I, a cable television talk show host, has been chosen to stand here and impart wisdom. I pray I never witness a more damning example of what is wrong with America today.

Graduates, faculty, parents, relatives, undergraduates, and old people that just come to these things - Good morning and congratulations to the Dartmouth Class of 2011. Today, you have achieved something special - something only 92 percent of Americans your age will ever know: a college diploma. That's right, with your college diploma you now have a crushing advantage over 8 percent of the workforce. I'm talking about dropout losers like Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and Mark Zuckerberg.

My first job as your commencement speaker is to illustrate that life is not fair. For example, you have worked tirelessly for four years to earn the diploma you'll be receiving this weekend, and Dartmouth is giving me the same degree for interviewing the fourth lead in Twilight. Deal with it.

I would like to thank President Kim for inviting me here today. But this is a wonderful occasion and it is great to be here in New Hampshire, where I am getting an honorary degree and all the legal fireworks I can fit in the trunk of my car.

To communicate with you students today, I have gone to great lengths to become well-versed in your unique linguistic patterns. Your school motto is "Vox Clamantis in Deserto," which means "Voice Crying Out in the Wilderness." This is easily the most pathetic school motto I have ever heard. Apparently, it narrowly beat out "Silently Weeping in Thick Shrub" and "Whimpering in Moist Leaves without Pants."

Your school color is green, and this color was chosen by Frederick Mather in 1867 because, and this is true, "it was the only color that had not been taken already." I cannot remember hearing anything so sad. Dartmouth, you have an inferiority complex, and you should not.

No, Dartmouth, you must stand tall. Raise your heads high and feel proud.

Because if Harvard, Yale, and Princeton are your self-involved, vain, name-dropping older brothers, you are the cool, sexually confident, Lacrosse playing younger sibling who knows how to throw a party and looks good in a down vest. Brown, of course, is your lesbian sister who never leaves her room. And Penn, Columbia, and Cornell... well, frankly, who gives a shit.

Yes, I've always had a special bond with this school. But fate dealt a heavy blow. With no money, I was forced to enroll in a small, local commuter school, a pulsating sore on a muddy elbow of the Charles River. I was a miserable wretch, and to this day I cannot help but wonder: What if I had gone to Dartmouth?

You are a great school, and you deserve a historic commencement address. That's right, I want my message today to be forever remembered because it changed the world. To do this, I must suggest groundbreaking policy. I call it The Conan Doctrine.

Besides policy, another hallmark of great commencement speeches is deep, profound advice like "reach for the stars." Well today, I am not going to waste your time with empty clichés. Instead, I am going to give you real, practical advice that you will need to know if you are going to survive the next few years.

First, adult acne lasts longer than you think. Guys: this is important -- you cannot iron a shirt while wearing it. If you live on Ramen Noodles for too long, you lose all feeling in your hands. And finally, wearing colorful Converse high-tops beneath your graduation robe is a great way to tell your classmates that this is just the first of many horrible decisions you plan to make with your life.

Yes, you parents must be patient because it is indeed a grim job market out there. And one of the reasons that it's so tough finding work is that aging baby boomers refuse to leave their jobs. Trust me on this. Even when they promise you for five years that they are going to leave... and say it on television... there is no guarantee they won't come back.

But enough. This is not a time for grim prognostications or negativity. No, I came here today because, believe it or not, I actually do have something real to tell you.

Eleven years ago I gave an address to a graduating class at Harvard. I have not spoken at a graduation since because I thought I had nothing left to say. But then 2010 came. And now I'm here, three thousand miles from my home, because I learned a hard but profound lesson last year and I'd like to share it with you.

In 2000, I told graduates "Don't be afraid to fail." Well now I'm here to tell you that, though you should not fear failure, you should do your very best to avoid it. Nietzsche famously said "Whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger." But what he failed to stress is that IT ALMOST KILLS YOU. Disappointment stings and, for driven, successful people like yourselves it is disorienting.

By definition, Commencement speakers at an Ivy League college are considered successful. But a little over a year ago, I experienced a profound and very public disappointment. I did not get what I wanted, and I left a system that had nurtured and help define me for the better part of seventeen years.

But then something spectacular happened. Fogbound, with no compass, and adrift, I started trying things. I grew a strange, cinnamon beard. I dove into the world of social media and started tweeting my comedy. I threw together a national tour. I played the guitar, did stand-up, wore a skin-tight blue leather suit, recorded an album, made a documentary, and frightened my friends and family.

Ultimately, I abandoned all preconceived perceptions of my career path and stature and took a job on basic cable with a network most famous for showing re-runs. I did a lot of silly, unconventional, spontaneous and seemingly irrational things and guess what - with the exception of the blue leather suit, it was the most satisfying and fascinating year of my professional life.

How could this be true? It's simple: there are few things more liberating in this life than having your worst fear realized.

Your path at 22 will not necessarily be your path at 32 or 42. One's dream is constantly evolving, rising and falling, changing course. This happens in every job, but because I have worked in comedy for twenty five years, I can speak best about my own profession.

It is our failure to become our perceived ideal that ultimately defines us and makes us unique. It's not easy, but if you accept your misfortune and handle it right, your perceived failure can be a catalyst for profound re-invention.

So, at the age of 47, after 25 years of obsessively pursuing my dream, that dream changed. For decades, in show business, the ultimate goal of every comedian was to host The Tonight Show. It was the Holy Grail, and like many people I thought that achieving that goal would define me as successful. But that is not true. No specific job or career goal defines me and it should not define you.

In 2000, I told graduates to not be afraid to fail, and I still believe that. But today I tell you that whether you fear it or not, disappointment will come. The beauty is that through disappointment you can gain clarity, and with clarity comes conviction and true originality.

Many of you here today are getting your diploma at this Ivy League school because you have committed yourself to a dream and worked hard to achieve it. And there is no greater cliché in a commencement address than "follow your dream." Well I am here to tell you that whatever you think your dream is now, it will probably change. And that's okay.

Four years ago, many of you had a specific vision of what your college experience was going to be and who you were going to become. And I bet, today, most of you would admit that your time here was very different from what you imagined. But through the good and especially the bad, the person you are now is someone you could never have conjured in the fall of 2007.

I have told you many things today, most of it foolish but some of it true. I'd like to end my address by breaking a taboo and quoting myself from 17 months ago. At the end of my final program with NBC, just before signing off, I said "Work hard, be kind, and amazing things will happen." Today, receiving this honor and speaking to the Dartmouth Class of 2011 from behind a tree-trunk, I have never believed that more.

Thank you very much, and congratulations.`

    fullText: `Good morning President Bienen, the Board of Trustees, faculty, parents, family, friends, and the Class of 2006. Congratulations on your graduation, and thank you for allowing me the honor to be a part of it.

A few months ago, I came across an article in your student newspaper by Elaine Meyer. So, Elaine wrote this article entitled, "Challenge us, Senator Obama." I thought this seemed like a fair request, so I kept reading. And I noticed that Elaine set out a few expectations for this speech.

According to the article, I'm supposed to be inspirational, but not contrived. I'm supposed to be hopeful, but not cheesy. I should be political, but not too political.

And what she wrote next is precisely what I'd like to talk you about today. She said, "When people say they don't want to hear about politics in a commencement address, they are in part speaking of not wanting to hear about the outside world and its problems. We students have been insulated enough for the past four years that it shouldn't hurt us to be challenged for thirty minutes, especially on a day that marks our commencement into the 'real' world."

That struck me as an important statement. And it called to mind a passage from scriptures that some of you may know: Corinthians 13:11: "When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I felt as a child, I thought as a child. Now that I have become a man, I have put away childish things."

I bring this up because there's an assumption in rites of passage like this that growing up is just a function of age; that becoming an adult is an inevitable and natural progression. But in fact, I know a whole lot of thirty year olds and forty year olds and fifty year olds who are not yet full-grown.

So even today, as a U.S. Senator, I have to remind myself of certain lessons from my own youth - lessons about growing up and being true to my values and ideals.

The first lesson came during my first year in college. Back then I had a tendency, in my mother's words, to act a bit casual about my future. I rebelled, angry in the way that many young men in general, and young black man in particular, are angry, thinking that responsibility and hard work were old-fashioned conventions that didn't apply to me. I partied a little too much and studied just enough to get by.

And once, after a particularly long night of partying, we had spilled a little too much beer, broke a few too many bottles, and trashed a little too much of the dorm. And the next day, the mess was so bad that when one of the cleaning ladies saw it, she began to tear up. And when a girlfriend of mine heard about this, she said to me, "That woman could've been my grandmother, Barack. She spent her days cleaning up after somebody else's mess."

Which drove home for me the first lesson of growing up: The world doesn't just revolve around you. There's a lot of talk in this country about the federal deficit. But I think we should talk more about our empathy deficit - the ability to put ourselves in someone else's shoes; to see the world through those who are different from us - the child who's hungry, the laid-off steelworker, the immigrant woman cleaning your dorm room.

As you go on in life, cultivating this quality of empathy will become harder, not easier. There's no community service requirement in the real world; no one forcing you to care. You'll be free to live in neighborhoods with people who are exactly like yourself, and send your kids to the same schools, and narrow your concerns to what's going in your own little circle.

Not only that - we live in a culture that discourages empathy. A culture that too often tells us our principle goal in life is to be rich, thin, young, famous, safe, and entertained. A culture where those in power too often encourage these selfish impulses.

I hope you don't listen to this. I hope you choose to broaden, and not contract, your ambit of concern. Not because you have an obligation to those who are less fortunate, although you do have that obligation. Not because you have a debt to all of those who helped you get to where you are, although you do have that debt.

It's because you have an obligation to yourself. Because our individual salvation depends on collective salvation. And because it's only when you hitch your wagon to something larger than yourself that you will realize your true potential - and become full-grown.

The second lesson I learned after college, when I had this crazy idea that I wanted to be a community organizer and work in low-income neighborhoods. My mother and grandparents thought I should go to law school. My friends had applied for jobs on Wall Street. But I went ahead and wrote letters to every organization in the country that I could think of.

Even people who didn't know me were skeptical of my decision. I remember having a conversation with an older man I had met before I arrived in Chicago. I told him about my plans, and he looked at me and said, "Let me tell something. You look like a nice clean-cut young man, and you've got a nice voice. So let me give you a piece of advice - forget this community organizing business. You can't change the world, and people won't appreciate you trying. What you should do is go into television broadcasting. I'm telling you, you've got a future."

But I knew there was something in me that wanted to try for something bigger.

So the second lesson is this: Challenge yourself. Take some risks in your life.

This may be difficult for all of you because one of the great things about graduating from Northwestern is that you can now punch your own ticket. You can take your diploma, walk off this stage, and go chasing after the big house and the large salary and the nice suits and all the other things that our money culture says you should buy.

But I hope you don't. Focusing your life solely on making a buck shows a poverty of ambition. It asks too little of yourself. And it will leave you unfulfilled.

So don't let people talk you into doing the safe thing. Listen to what's inside of you and decide what it is that you care about so much that you're willing to risk it all.

The third lesson is one that I learned once I got to Chicago. I had spent weeks organizing our very first community meeting around the issue of gang violence. The night of the meeting we arranged rows and rows of chairs in anticipation of the crowd. And we waited. And we waited. And finally, a group of older people walk in to the hall. And they sit down. And this little old lady raises her hand and asks, "Is this where the bingo game is?"

Thirteen people showed up that night. The police never came. And the meeting was a complete disaster. Later, the volunteers I worked with told me they were quitting - that they had been doing this for two years and had nothing to show for it.

I was tired too. But at that point, I looked outside and saw some young boys playing in a vacant lot across the street, tossing stones at boarded-up apartment building. And I turned to the volunteers, and I asked them, "Before you quit, I want you to answer one question. What's gonna happen to those boys? Who will fight for them if not us? Who will give them a fair shot if we leave?" And at that moment, we were all reminded of a third lesson in growing up: Persevere.

Making your mark on the world is hard. If it were easy, everybody would do it. But it's not. It takes patience, it takes commitment, and it comes with plenty of failure along the way. The real test is not whether you avoid this failure, because you won't. it's whether you let it harden or shame you into inaction, or whether you learn from it; whether you choose to persevere.

Cultivating empathy, challenging yourself, persevering in the face of adversity - these are the qualities that I've found to be important in my own life. But what's true for individuals can also be true for nations.

For what America needs right now, more than ever, is a sense of purpose to guide us through the challenges that lie ahead; a maturity that we seem to have lost somewhere along the way; a willingness to engage in a sober, adult conversation about our future.

Each and every one of these challenges call for an America that is more purposeful, more grown-up than the America that we have today. An America that reflects the lessons that have helped so many of its people mature in their own lives. An America that's about not just each of us, but all of us. An America that takes great risks in the face of greater odds. An America that, above all, perseveres.

And now it is 2006. And here you sit facing challenges as great as any in the past. And the choice is yours. Will the years pass with barely a whisper from your generation? Or will we look back on this time as the moment where you took a stand and changed the world?

Time will tell. You will be tested by the challenges of this new century, and at times you will fail. But know that you have it within your power to try. That generations who have come before you faced these same fears and uncertainties in their own time. And that if we're willing to shoulder each other's burdens, to take great risks, and to persevere through trial, America will continue on its magnificent journey towards that distant horizon, and a better day.

Thank you so much to the class of 2006, congratulations on your graduation.`

    fullText: `Good morning to the Class of 2018, the faculty, the parents, the grandparents, fellow honorees, and the paid laughers I have scattered throughout the audience.

It is an honor to join you this morning for this special occasion. It is also an honor to speak to you today from behind this gigantic tree stump. Like some sort of female Lorax with an advanced degree.

Before I get any further, I should actually probably clarify who I am for the parents and grandparents in the audience who are thinking to themselves, "Who is this loud Indian woman? Is that the girl from Quantico? She looks so much worse in person."

No, no, I'm not Priyanka Chopra, not even Padma Lakshmi. I'm the other Indian woman we have allowed to be on television, Mindy Kaling.

You may remember me from my role on The Office as Kelly Kapoor, who internet commenters said was "shrill" and "took up valuable time that could have gone to Steve Carell."

I then created and starred in my own TV show, The Mindy Project. It was an uphill battle to get the show on the air, but it was worth it, because it enabled me to become Dartmouth's most successful female minority show creator who has spoken at commencement!

Oh wait, no. Shonda Rhimes went here. Yup, and she's created like 10 more shows than me, so great.

But today is not about famous alumni. It's about the men and women who have toiled in obscurity for years so that they might better our country. I speak, of course, of the 51 percent of Dartmouth grads who will go into finance—highest in the Ivy League!

I know that going into the real world sounds scary, but it's exciting too. Finally, you'll be in control of your own lives. No longer will there be an irrational Board of Trustees telling you you can't have hard liquor on campus, for the ridiculous reason that they don't want you to die.

It's a real moment of reflection for me to be standing here speaking to all of you now, because it makes me harken back to my own time at my Dartmouth graduation. Madeleine Albright was my commencement speaker; and while I don't remember any specific quotes she said, or even a general gist of what she was talking about, I do remember thinking: "I wonder what it will be like to have my own cell phone?"

I bet none of you remember a time before the internet. Meanwhile, when I was in college we didn't even have Google. If you wanted to find out, say, how tall Ben Affleck was, you were out of luck. You just had to sit there, not knowing, and your entire day would be ruined.

Now we're reaching the part of the speech where I am supposed to tell you something uplifting like "follow your dreams."

In general, advice isn't actually an effective way to change your life. If all it took to make your life great was hearing amazing advice, then everyone who watched TED Talks would be a millionaire.

So don't trust any one story of how to become successful. So here is some practical advice that you may or may not remember at the end of this speech:

First off, remove "Proficient at Word" from your resume. That is ridiculous. You're really scraping the bottom of the barrel of competency there.

Most of your post-college life is simply filling out forms. Car insurance, health insurance, W-2s. W-4s, 1099s. Guess what? None of us know what any of those forms mean, but you will fill out a hundred of them before you die.

You never need more than one pancake. Trust me on this. Cartoons have trained us to want a giant stack of those bad boys, but order one first and then just see how you feel later.

This one is just for guys: When you go on dates, act as if every woman you're talking to is a reporter for an online publication that you are scared of. Date like everyone's watching, because we are.

And this might be the most important—buy a toilet plunger. Trust me on this. Don't wait until you need a plunger to buy a plunger.

Okay, now let's get real. Next year, the next year of your life is going to be bad. You have been in the comfortable fleece-lined womb of mother Dartmouth for four years now, and you're gonna go out in the cold, hard world.

You're graduating into a world where it seems like everything is falling apart. Trust in institutions are at a record low; the truth doesn't seem to matter anymore.

So, Class of 2018, you are entering a world that we have toppled like a Jenga tower, and we are relying on you to rebuild it.

But how can you do that with the knowledge that things are so unstable out there? I'll tell you my secret, the one thing that has kept me going through the years, my superpower: delusion.

My point is, you have to have insane confidence in yourself, even if it's not real. You need to be your own cheerleader now, because there isn't a room full of people waiting with pom-poms to tell you, "You did it! We've been waiting all this time for you to succeed!"

So, I'm giving you permission to root for yourself. And while you're at it, root for those around you, too. It took me a long time to realize that success isn't a zero-sum game.

I thought I might take a second to speak to the ladies in the audience. Hey girls, we need to do a better job of supporting each other. I know that I am guilty of it too. We live in a world where it seems like there's only room for one of us at the table. So when another woman shows up, we think, "Oh my god, she's going to take the one woman spot! That was supposed to be mine!"

But that's just what certain people want us to do! Wouldn't it be better if we worked together to dismantle a system that makes us feel like there's limited room for us? Because when women work together, we can accomplish anything.

Now I wanted to share a little bit about me, Mindy Kaling, the Dartmouth student. When I came to Hanover in the fall of 1997, I was, as many of you were: driven, bright, ambitious.

I arrived here as a 17-year-old, took the lay of the land, and immediately began making a checklist of everything I wanted to accomplish. And I completed that checklist.

Then, I graduated. And I made a new checklist for my twenties: get married by 27, have kids at 30, win an Oscar, be the star of my own TV show, and do it all while being a size 2.

Well, spoiler alert: I've only done one of those things, and I'm not sure I will ever do the others. And that is a really scary feeling. Knowing how far that I've strayed from the person that I was hoping to be when I was 21.

I will tell you a personal story. After my daughter was born in December, I remember bringing her home and being in my house with her for the first time and thinking, "According to movies and TV, this is traditionally the time when my mother and spouse are supposed to be here, sharing this experience with me." And I looked around, and I had neither. And for a moment, it was kind of scary. Like, "Can I do this by myself?"

But then, that feeling went away, because the reality is, I'm not doing it by myself. I'm surrounded by family and friends who love and support me. And the joy I feel from being with my daughter Katherine eclipses anything from any crazy checklist.

So I just want to tell you guys, don't be scared if you don't do things in the right order, or if you don't do some things at all. I didn't think I'd have a child before I got married, but hey, it turned out that way, and I wouldn't change a thing.

So if I could impart any advice, it's this: If you have a checklist, good for you. Structured ambition can sometimes be motivating. But also, feel free to let it go.

I was not someone who should have the life I have now, and yet I do. I was sitting in the chair you are literally sitting in right now and I just whispered, "Why not me?" And I kept whispering it for seventeen years; and here I am, someone that this school deemed worthy enough to speak to you at your Commencement.

Don't let anyone tell you that you can't do something, but especially not yourself. Go conquer the world. Just remember this: Why not you? You made it this far.

Thank you very much, and congratulations to the Class of 2018.`

    fullText: `I never really expected to find myself giving advice to people graduating from an establishment of higher education. I never graduated from any such establishment. I never even started at one. I escaped from school as soon as I could, when the prospect of four more years of enforced learning before I'd become the writer I wanted to be was stifling.

I got out into the world, I wrote, and I became a better writer the more I wrote, and I wrote some more, and nobody ever seemed to mind that I was making it up as I went along, they just read what I wrote and they paid for it, or they didn't, and often they commissioned me to write something else for them.

Looking back, I've had a remarkable ride. I'm not sure I can call it a career, because a career implies that I had some kind of career plan, and I never did. The nearest thing I had was a list I made when I was 15 of everything I wanted to do: to write an adult novel, a children's book, a comic, a movie, record an audiobook, write an episode of Doctor Who… and so on. I didn't have a career. I just did the next thing on the list.

So I thought I'd tell you everything I wish I'd known starting out, and a few things that, looking back on it, I suppose that I did know. And that I would also give you the best piece of advice I'd ever got, which I completely failed to follow.

First of all: When you start out on a career in the arts you have no idea what you are doing.

This is great. People who know what they are doing know the rules, and know what is possible and impossible. You do not. And you should not. The rules on what is possible and impossible in the arts were made by people who had not tested the bounds of the possible by going beyond them. And you can.

If you don't know it's impossible it's easier to do. And because nobody's done it before, they haven't made up rules to stop anyone doing that again, yet.

Secondly, If you have an idea of what you want to make, what you were put here to do, then just go and do that.

And that's much harder than it sounds and, sometimes in the end, so much easier than you might imagine. Because normally, there are things you have to do before you can get to the place you want to be. I wanted to write comics and novels and stories and films, so I became a journalist, because journalists are allowed to ask questions, and to simply go and find out how the world works, and besides, to do those things I needed to write and to write well, and I was being paid to learn how to write economically, crisply, sometimes under adverse conditions, and on time.

Something that worked for me was imagining that where I wanted to be – an author, primarily of fiction, making good books, making good comics and supporting myself through my words – was a mountain. A distant mountain. My goal.

And I knew that as long as I kept walking towards the mountain I would be all right. And when I truly was not sure what to do, I could stop, and think about whether it was taking me towards or away from the mountain.

Thirdly, When you start off, you have to deal with the problems of failure. You need to be thickskinned, to learn that not every project will survive. A freelance life, a life in the arts, is sometimes like putting messages in bottles, on a desert island, and hoping that someone will find one of your bottles and open it and read it, and put something in a bottle that will wash its way back to you: appreciation, or a commission, or money, or love. And you have to accept that you may put out a hundred things for every bottle that winds up coming back.

The problems of failure are problems of discouragement, of hopelessness, of hunger. You want everything to happen and you want it now, and things go wrong.

And I shrugged, and I still had my electric typewriter and enough money to pay the rent for a couple of months, and I decided that I would do my best in future not to write books just for the money. If you didn't get the money, then you didn't have anything. If I did work I was proud of, and I didn't get the money, at least I'd have the work.

Every now and again, I forget that rule, and whenever I do, the universe kicks me hard and reminds me. I don't know that it's an issue for anybody but me, but it's true that nothing I did where the only reason for doing it was the money was ever worth it, except as bitter experience. Usually I didn't wind up getting the money, either. The things I did because I was excited, and wanted to see them exist in reality have never let me down, and I've never regretted the time I spent on any of them.

The problems of failure are hard.

The problems of success can be harder, because nobody warns you about them.

The first problem of any kind of even limited success is the unshakable conviction that you are getting away with something, and that any moment now they will discover you. It's Imposter Syndrome, something my wife Amanda christened the Fraud Police.

Fourthly, I hope you'll make mistakes. If you're making mistakes, it means you're out there doing something. And the mistakes in themselves can be useful. I once misspelled Caroline, in a letter, transposing the A and the O, and I thought, "Coraline looks like a real name…"

And remember that whatever discipline you are in, whether you are a musician or a photographer, a fine artist or a cartoonist, a writer, a dancer, a designer, whatever you do you have one thing that's unique. You have the ability to make art.

And for me, and for so many of the people I have known, that's been a lifesaver. The ultimate lifesaver. It gets you through good times and it gets you through the other ones.

Life is sometimes hard. Things go wrong, in life and in love and in business and in friendship and in health and in all the other ways that life can go wrong. And when things get tough, this is what you should do.

Make good art.

I'm serious. Husband runs off with a politician? Make good art. Leg crushed and then eaten by mutated boa constrictor? Make good art. IRS on your trail? Make good art. Cat exploded? Make good art. Somebody on the Internet thinks what you do is stupid or evil or it's all been done before? Make good art. Probably things will work out somehow, and eventually time will take the sting away, but that doesn't matter. Do what only you do best. Make good art.

Make it on the good days too.

And Fifthly, while you are at it, make your art. Do the stuff that only you can do.

The urge, starting out, is to copy. And that's not a bad thing. Most of us only find our own voices after we've sounded like a lot of other people. But the one thing that you have that nobody else has is you. Your voice, your mind, your story, your vision. So write and draw and build and play and dance and live as only you can.

The moment that you feel that, just possibly, you're walking down the street naked, exposing too much of your heart and your mind and what exists on the inside, showing too much of yourself. That's the moment you may be starting to get it right.

The things I've done that worked the best were the things I was the least certain about, the stories where I was sure they would either work, or more likely be the kinds of embarrassing failures people would gather together and talk about until the end of time. They always had that in common: looking back at them, people explain why they were inevitable successes. While I was doing them, I had no idea.

I still don't. And where would be the fun in making something you knew was going to work?

Sixthly. I will pass on some secret freelancer knowledge. Secret knowledge is always good. And it is useful for anyone who ever plans to create art for other people, to enter a freelance world of any kind.

People get hired because, somehow, they get hired. People keep working, in a freelance world, and more and more of today's world is freelance, because their work is good, and because they are easy to get along with, and because they deliver the work on time. And you don't even need all three. Two out of three is fine. People will tolerate how unpleasant you are if your work is good and you deliver it on time. They'll forgive the lateness of the work if it's good, and if they like you. And you don't have to be as good as the others if you're on time and it's always a pleasure to hear from you.

When I agreed to give this address, I started trying to think what the best advice I'd been given over the years was.

And it came from Stephen King twenty years ago, at the height of the success of Sandman. I was writing a comic that people loved and were taking seriously. King had liked Sandman and my novel with Terry Pratchett, Good Omens, and he saw the madness, the long signing lines, all that, and his advice was this:

"This is really great. You should enjoy it."

And I didn't. Best advice I got that I ignored. Instead I worried about it. I worried about the next deadline, the next idea, the next story. There wasn't a moment for the next fourteen or fifteen years that I wasn't writing something in my head, or wondering about it. And I didn't stop and look around and go, this is really fun. I wish I'd enjoyed it more.

That was the hardest lesson for me, I think: to let go and enjoy the ride, because the ride takes you to some remarkable and unexpected places.

To all today's graduates: I wish you luck. Luck is useful. Often you will discover that the harder you work, and the more wisely you work, the luckier you get. But there is luck, and it helps.

We're in a transitional world right now, if you're in any kind of artistic field, because the nature of distribution is changing, the models by which creators got their work out into the world, and got to keep a roof over their heads and buy sandwiches while they did that, are all changing.

Which is, on the one hand, intimidating, and on the other, immensely liberating. The rules, the assumptions, the now-we're supposed to's of how you get your work seen, and what you do then, are breaking down. The gatekeepers are leaving their gates. You can be as creative as you need to be to get your work seen.

So make up your own rules.

Someone asked me recently how to do something she thought was going to be difficult, in this case recording an audio book, and I suggested she pretend that she was someone who could do it. Not pretend to do it, but pretend she was someone who could.

So be wise, because the world needs more wisdom, and if you cannot be wise, pretend to be someone who is wise, and then just behave like they would.

And now go, and make interesting mistakes, make amazing mistakes, make glorious and fantastic mistakes. Break rules. Leave the world more interesting for your being here. Make good art.`

    fullText: `Thank you for that warm introduction. It's an honor to be here with you today at this historic institution, speaking to the graduating class of 2017.

When I look out at all of you, I see the future. I see leaders, innovators, change-makers. But more importantly, I see individuals who have the power to be different, to stand out, and to make a lasting impact on this world.

Let me start by telling you a little about my journey. I grew up in a housing project on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. My mother was a single parent who cleaned offices and ironed shirts to make ends meet. We didn't have much, but what we had was determination, grit, and the belief that education could change everything.

I was different from day one. I was loud when I was supposed to be quiet. I asked questions when I was supposed to just listen. I challenged the status quo when I was supposed to accept it. And you know what? That difference became my superpower.

When I started at Xerox as a summer intern in 1980, I was one of the few African American women in the building. I could have tried to blend in, to make myself smaller, to not rock the boat. Instead, I chose to be authentically me. I spoke up in meetings. I challenged processes that didn't make sense. I took on assignments that others thought were too risky.

Some people told me to tone it down. They said I was too direct, too aggressive, too different. But I learned something important early on: the very things that make you different are often the things that make you valuable.

Throughout my career, I've seen too many talented people dim their light because they were afraid of standing out. They were afraid of being the only one in the room who looked like them, thought like them, or had their background. But here's what I want you to understand: diversity isn't just about fairness – it's about excellence.

When I became CEO of Xerox in 2009, I became the first African American woman to lead a Fortune 500 company. That wasn't just a personal milestone – it was a statement about what's possible when we embrace difference instead of fearing it.

But being different isn't always easy. There will be times when you walk into rooms where you're the only one who looks like you. There will be moments when people question whether you belong. There will be days when you doubt yourself.

In those moments, I want you to remember this: you weren't meant to fit in. You were meant to stand out. You were meant to bring something to the table that no one else can bring. Your perspective, your experience, your unique way of seeing the world – that's not a liability, it's an asset.

I've learned that leadership isn't about having all the answers. It's about asking the right questions. It's about being willing to make tough decisions, even when they're unpopular. It's about surrounding yourself with people who complement your strengths and challenge your thinking.

But most importantly, leadership is about authenticity. You cannot lead effectively if you're trying to be someone you're not. People can sense authenticity from a mile away, and they can sense its absence just as easily.

So as you leave this institution and enter the next phase of your lives, I want to challenge you with three things:

First, dare to be different. Don't try to fit into someone else's mold. The world doesn't need another copy of someone else. It needs the original you. Embrace what makes you unique, and use it as your competitive advantage.

Second, take risks. The biggest risk is not taking any risks at all. Throughout my career, I've taken on roles that others thought were too challenging, too risky, or too ambitious. But those risks led to the greatest rewards. Don't let fear of failure keep you from pursuing your dreams.

Third, lift others as you climb. Success isn't just about what you achieve for yourself. It's about opening doors for others who will come after you. Be the leader who creates opportunities for others to be different, to stand out, to succeed.

I want to share something with you that my mother told me when I was young. She said, "Ursula, you have two choices in life. You can be a victim of your circumstances, or you can be the architect of your future." I chose to be the architect, and I want each of you to make that same choice.

The world is changing rapidly. Technology is transforming how we work, how we communicate, how we live. In this environment, the ability to adapt, to think differently, to bring fresh perspectives – these aren't just nice-to-have qualities. They're essential.

You are graduating at a time when the world needs your energy, your ideas, your different way of seeing things. Don't waste that opportunity by trying to be like everyone else.

I'll leave you with this thought: Throughout history, every major breakthrough, every significant change, every leap forward has come from someone who dared to be different. Someone who was willing to challenge conventional thinking. Someone who refused to accept that "this is just how things are done."

You have that same power. You have the ability to look at problems differently, to find solutions that others miss, to create change where others see only obstacles.

So go out there and be different. Be bold. Be authentic. Be the leader the world needs you to be. And remember, your difference isn't something to overcome – it's something to celebrate and leverage.

The future belongs to those who dare to be different. Make sure you're one of them.

Congratulations, Class of 2017. Now go out there and change the world.

Thank you.`

    fullText: `President Frederick, distinguished faculty, proud families, and most importantly, the graduating class of 2016 – congratulations on this remarkable achievement.

It is a profound honor to stand before you today at this historic institution, a place that has been a beacon of excellence and opportunity for generations of African American leaders. Howard University has always been more than just a university – it has been a launching pad for change-makers, innovators, and leaders who have shaped our nation and our world.

As I look out at all of you today, I see the future of leadership in America. But I also see young people entering a world that is changing at an unprecedented pace. The question is not whether change will come – it's how you will lead through that change.

Let me share with you some lessons I've learned about leadership during my time as CEO of American Express, lessons that I believe will serve you well as you embark on your own leadership journeys.

First, leadership is not about being popular. It's about making the tough decisions and doing what's right, even when it's difficult, even when it's unpopular, even when it costs you something personally.

Throughout my career, I've had to make decisions that weren't popular with employees, with shareholders, with the media, or even with my own family. But leadership isn't a popularity contest. It's about having the courage to do what you believe is right for the long-term success of your organization and the people you serve.

When the financial crisis hit in 2008, we had to make some incredibly difficult decisions at American Express. We had to cut costs, reduce our workforce, and fundamentally change how we operated. These weren't popular decisions, but they were necessary decisions. And because we made them quickly and decisively, we emerged from the crisis stronger than ever.

Second, embrace change as an opportunity, not a threat. The world is changing faster today than at any point in human history. Technology is transforming every industry. Globalization is creating new markets and new competition. Social movements are reshaping how we think about equality and justice.

You can either be overwhelmed by this change, or you can see it as the greatest opportunity of your lifetime. I choose to see it as an opportunity, and I encourage you to do the same.

At American Express, we've had to completely reimagine our business model multiple times during my tenure. We've gone from being primarily a charge card company to being a global payments and travel company. We've embraced digital technology, mobile payments, and data analytics. We've expanded into new markets and new customer segments.

Each of these changes was challenging, but each one also opened up new possibilities for growth and innovation. The companies and leaders who thrive in the 21st century will be those who can adapt quickly and turn change into competitive advantage.

Third, character matters more than charisma. In our celebrity-obsessed culture, we often confuse leadership with charisma. We think leaders need to be the loudest voice in the room, the most charming personality, the most telegenic presence.

But true leadership is about character – about integrity, honesty, humility, and moral courage. It's about doing the right thing when no one is watching. It's about keeping your word even when it's inconvenient. It's about admitting when you're wrong and learning from your mistakes.

I've worked with many charismatic people who were terrible leaders, and I've worked with many quiet, humble people who were extraordinary leaders. Charisma might get you noticed, but character is what earns you respect and trust.

Fourth, diversity is not just the right thing to do – it's the smart thing to do. As leaders, you will be responsible for bringing together people from different backgrounds, different perspectives, different experiences. This diversity isn't just about fairness or political correctness. It's about performance.

Study after study has shown that diverse teams make better decisions, solve problems more creatively, and deliver better results. When you surround yourself with people who think differently than you do, you make better choices.

But diversity only works if you create an environment where different voices can be heard and different perspectives can be valued. As leaders, it's your job to create that environment.

Fifth, build bridges, don't build walls. We live in an increasingly polarized world. People retreat into their own echo chambers, surrounding themselves only with people who agree with them. Social media amplifies our differences and minimizes our common ground.

As leaders, you have a responsibility to build bridges across these divides. You need to be able to work with people who don't look like you, don't think like you, don't vote like you. You need to find common ground and build coalitions around shared values and shared goals.

This doesn't mean compromising your principles. It means being principled enough to work with others who share your commitment to making progress, even if you disagree on some of the details.

Finally, remember that leadership is a privilege, not a right. Every leadership position you hold, every opportunity you're given to make a difference, is a privilege that comes with enormous responsibility.

You have a responsibility to the people you lead, to the organizations you serve, and to the communities you're part of. You have a responsibility to use your platform to make things better, not just for yourself, but for others.

As graduates of Howard University, you carry a special responsibility. You are part of a legacy of leaders who have broken barriers, challenged injustice, and opened doors for others. That legacy doesn't end with your graduation – it continues with what you do next.

The world needs your leadership. It needs your energy, your ideas, your passion for justice and equality. It needs your willingness to take on tough challenges and make difficult decisions.

But most of all, it needs your commitment to doing what's right, even when it's hard, even when it's unpopular, even when it costs you something.

The future belongs to leaders who can navigate change with courage, who can build bridges across differences, who can make tough decisions with integrity, and who can inspire others to be their best selves.

You have all the tools you need to be those leaders. You have the education, the intelligence, the passion, and the character. Now it's time to go out and use them.

The world is waiting for your leadership. Don't keep it waiting too long.

Congratulations again, Class of 2016. Now go out there and lead.

Thank you.`

    fullText: `President Klawe, faculty, families, and graduates of Harvey Mudd College – congratulations on this extraordinary achievement.

It is truly an honor to be here with you today at one of the most prestigious science and engineering institutions in the world. When I look out at all of you, I see the future of innovation, discovery, and human progress.

You know, when I was growing up, people often asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up. And I would say, "I want to be a scientist, a dancer, and an astronaut." And they would look at me like I was crazy. They would say, "You have to pick one. You can't do all of those things."

But I'm here to tell you today that you don't have to pick just one thing. You don't have to fit into someone else's narrow definition of what a scientist looks like, what an engineer does, or what's possible for your life.

I became a doctor, an engineer, a dancer, and yes, an astronaut. I've traveled to space, but I've also danced with the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. I've conducted medical research, but I've also studied art and African studies. I've worked on spacecraft, but I've also worked on sustainable development in Africa.

The point is this: don't let anyone rob you of your imagination, your creativity, or your curiosity. It's your place in the world; it's your life. Go on and do all you can with it.

As graduates of Harvey Mudd, you have been trained in some of the most rigorous scientific and mathematical disciplines in the world. You have the tools to solve complex problems, to innovate, to create technologies that can change the world. But I want to challenge you to think beyond just the technical aspects of your education.

Science and technology are not separate from the rest of human experience. They are deeply connected to art, to culture, to social justice, to the human condition. The best scientists and engineers I know are those who understand these connections and use them to inform their work.

When I was selected to be an astronaut, I wasn't chosen just because of my technical qualifications. I was chosen because I brought a unique perspective – as a woman, as an African American, as someone who had lived and worked in different cultures, as someone who understood that science is not just about formulas and equations, but about improving the human condition.

In space, when I looked down at Earth, I didn't see the political boundaries that divide us. I didn't see the artificial barriers that we create between disciplines, between cultures, between people. I saw one beautiful, interconnected planet that we all share.

That perspective changed me, and I want it to change how you think about your role as scientists and engineers. You are not just problem solvers – you are world changers. You are not just technicians – you are visionaries. You are not just graduates of Harvey Mudd – you are citizens of the world with a responsibility to use your talents to make life better for everyone.

But let me be clear: this won't always be easy. You will face challenges, setbacks, and people who doubt you. I certainly did.

When I applied to be an astronaut, I was told that I didn't fit the profile. When I wanted to study both engineering and African studies, I was told to focus on one or the other. When I talked about the importance of including art and culture in space missions, some people thought I wasn't serious about science.

But I persisted, because I knew that my different perspective was not a weakness – it was a strength. And I want you to remember that when you face similar challenges.

Your diversity – whether it's your gender, your race, your background, your interests, your way of thinking – is not something to overcome. It's something to celebrate and leverage. The world needs your unique perspective.

Science and engineering have historically been dominated by people who look and think a certain way. But the challenges we face today – climate change, disease, poverty, inequality – are too complex to be solved by any one group of people. We need all hands on deck. We need all perspectives at the table.

As you leave Harvey Mudd and enter your careers, I want you to remember three things:

First, stay curious. The moment you stop asking questions, the moment you think you have all the answers, is the moment you stop growing as a scientist and as a human being. The universe is vast and mysterious, and there is always more to learn, more to discover, more to explore.

Second, think big. Don't limit yourself to incremental improvements or safe projects. The world needs breakthrough innovations, paradigm shifts, revolutionary ideas. You have the training and the talent to tackle the biggest challenges facing humanity. Don't waste that potential on small problems.

Third, remember your responsibility to humanity. Science and technology are powerful tools, but they are just tools. What matters is how you use them. Use them to heal, not to harm. Use them to unite, not to divide. Use them to lift up the most vulnerable members of our society, not just to benefit the privileged few.

I want to share with you one of my favorite quotes from the great scientist and humanitarian Albert Einstein: "A human being is a part of the whole called by us universe, a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feeling as something separated from the rest, a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty."

That's what I want for all of you – to widen your circle of compassion, to see beyond the boundaries that others try to impose on you, to use your scientific training not just to understand the universe, but to make it a better place for all of us.

You are graduating at an incredible time in human history. We are on the verge of breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, quantum computing, biotechnology, space exploration, and so many other fields. The next few decades will see changes that will make the last century look slow by comparison.

You have the opportunity to be part of that transformation. You have the opportunity to be the generation that solves climate change, that cures cancer, that takes humanity to Mars, that creates technologies we can't even imagine today.

But remember, as you reach for the stars – literally and figuratively – don't forget to keep your feet grounded in humanity. Don't forget that the ultimate goal of all our scientific endeavors should be to improve life for everyone on this planet.

The stars are calling, and you are ready to answer. Go forth and explore. Go forth and discover. Go forth and change the world.

Congratulations, Class of 2015. The universe is waiting for you.

Thank you.`

    fullText: `President Wagner, members of the Board of Trustees, distinguished faculty, parents, family, and friends, and to the class of 2014, I'm delighted and very pleased to be with you on this important occasion.

Now let me join President Wagner in saying congratulations to each and every one of you who are receiving a degree. Congratulations. This is your day. Enjoy it. Be happy. Just be happy, have a little fun. Smile. You look good. You look beautiful, handsome.

And let me just tell you for a moment, I didn't grow up in a big city like Atlanta. I grew up in rural Alabama, 50 miles from Montgomery outside of a little place called Troy. My father was a sharecropper, but back in 1944 when I was only four years old, my father had saved $300. And with the $300, he bought 110 acres of land. My family still own that land today.

It was many, many years ago, when we would visit the little town of Troy, visit Montgomery, visit Tuskegee, visit Birmingham, I saw those signs that said 'white men, coloured men', 'white women, coloured women,' 'white waiting, coloured waiting.' I would come home and ask my mother, my father, my grandparents, my great-grandparents, 'Why?' And they would say, 'That's the way it is. Don't get in the way, don't get in trouble!'

But one day in 1955, 15 years old in the 10th grade, I heard about Rosa Parks. I heard the words of Martin Luther King Jr on our radio. In 1957, I met Rosa Parks at the age of 17. In 1958 at the age of 18, I met Martin Luther King Jr, and these two individuals inspired me to get in the way, to get in trouble.

So I come here to say to you this morning, on this beautiful campus, with your great education, you must find a way to get in the way. You must find a way to get in trouble. Good trouble. Necessary trouble.

Use your education. You have wonderful teachers, wonderful professors, researchers. Use what you have. Use your learning. Use your tools. To help make our country and make our world a better place where no one would be left out or left behind. You can do it and you must do it. It is your time.

In a few short days, we will commemorate what we call the Mississippi Summer Project, when more than a thousand students from all over America, many from abroad, made a trip to Mississippi to encourage people to register to vote. And on the summer night of June 21st, 1964, three young men that I knew, two whites and one African American, went out to investigate the burning of an African American church that was used for voter registration workshop. These three young men were detained by the sheriff, taken to jail, taken out of jail, turned over to the Klan where they were beaten, shot and killed.

And I tell students today, these three young men didn't die in Vietnam. They didn't die in the Middle East or Eastern Europe. They didn't die in Africa or Central or South America. They died right here in our own country, trying to help all of our citizens become participants in the democratic process.

As young people, you must understand that there are forces that want to take us back to another period, but you must say that we're not going back. We made too much progress and we are going forward.

There may be some setbacks, some delays, some disappointment, but you must never ever give up, or give in. You must keep the faith and keep your eyes on the prize. That is your calling, that is your mission, that is your moral obligation, that is your mandate. Get out there and do it, get in the way!

In the final analysis, we all must learn to live together as brothers and sisters, not just in America, but around the world.

You know, I got arrested a few times during the sixties, 40 times, and all of the charges were dropped and dismissed. But since I've been in Congress and young people ask me, how can you be in Congress, you got arrested so many times. I've been arrested since I've been in Congress, five more times. And I may get arrested again.

The last time I got arrested was trying to say to the Congress, we need to pass comprehensive immigration reform and set people on a path to citizenship. It's the right thing to do.

It doesn't make sense that we live in our country, we live in a society where more than 12 million people are living in the shadow, living in fear. That is not right. That is not fair. And that is not just, and you must get in the way and find a way to make the way out of no way.

When I was growing up outside of Troy, Alabama, I had an aunt by the name of Sineva and my Aunt Sineva lived in what we call a 'shotgun house.' My aunt Sineva didn't have a green manicured lawn, had a simple plain dirt yard. And sometime at night, you could look up through the holes in the ceiling, the holes in the tin roof and count the stars. And when it rained she would get a pail, a bucket or tub and catch the rain water.

From time to time, she would walk out into the woods and cut branches from a Dogwood tree and tie these branches together and make what she called a 'brush broom'. And she would sweep the dirt yard very clean, sometime two and three times a week, but especially on a Friday or Saturday because she wanted that dirt yard to look good during the weekend.

One Saturday afternoon, a group of my brothers and sisters, and a few of my first cousins were out playing in my Aunt Sineva's dirt yard. And an unbelievable storm came up. The wind started blowing. The thunder started rolling. The lightning started flashing and the rain started beating on the tin roof of this old shotgun house. My aunt became terrified. She started crying. She thought this whole house was going to blow away.

When it appeared that one corner of the house was going to blow away, my aunt had us all hold hands and walk to that side, to try to hold the house down with our little bodies. When another corner appeared to be lifting, she had us walk to that side. We were little children walking with the wind, but we never left the house.

I say to you, as you leave here, leave this beautiful campus. The wind may blow. The thunder may roll, the lightning may flash, and the rain may beat on our old house. Call it a house of Emory, call it a house of Georgia or Alabama or New York. Call it a house of Europe. Call it a house of Africa. Call it a house of Asia. Of Central or South America. Call it a house of the Middle East.

We all live in the same house, and it doesn't matter whether we are black or white, Latino, Asian American, or Native American. It doesn't matter if we are straight or gay. We are one people. We are one family. We all live in the same house.

Be bold. Be courageous, stand up, speak up, speak out and find a way to create the beloved community. The beloved world. A world of peace, a world that recognizes the dignity of all humankind. Never become bitter, never become hostile, never hate. Live in peace. We are one, one people and one love.

Thank you very much.`

    fullText: `So it's 2006. My friend Harold Ford calls me. He's running for U.S. Senate in Tennessee, and he says, "Mellody, I desperately need some national press. Do you have any ideas?" So I had an idea. I called a friend who was in New York at one of the most successful media companies in the world, and she said, "Why don't we host an editorial board lunch for Harold? You come with him."

Harold and I arrive in New York. We are in our best suits. We look like shiny new pennies. And we get to the receptionist, and we say, "We're here for the lunch." She motions for us to follow her. We walk through a series of corridors, and all of a sudden we find ourselves in a stark room, at which point she looks at us and she says, "Where are your uniforms?"

Just as this happens, my friend rushes in. The blood drains from her face. There are literally no words, right? And I look at her, and I say, "Now, don't you think we need more than one black person in the U.S. Senate?"

Now Harold and I — we still laugh about that story, and in many ways, the moment caught me off guard, but deep, deep down inside, I actually wasn't surprised. And I wasn't surprised because of something my mother taught me about 30 years before. You see, my mother was ruthlessly realistic. I remember one day coming home from a birthday party where I was the only black kid invited, and instead of asking me the normal motherly questions like, "Did you have fun?" or "How was the cake?" my mother looked at me and she said, "How did they treat you?" I was seven. I did not understand. I mean, why would anyone treat me differently? But she knew. And she looked me right in the eye and she said, "They will not always treat you well."

Now, race is one of those topics in America that makes people extraordinarily uncomfortable. You bring it up at a dinner party or in a workplace environment, it is literally the conversational equivalent of touching the third rail. There is shock, followed by a long silence. And even coming here today, I told some friends and colleagues that I planned to talk about race, and they warned me, they told me, don't do it, that there'd be huge risks in me talking about this topic, that people might think I'm a militant black woman and I would ruin my career. And I have to tell you, I actually for a moment was a bit afraid. Then I realized, the first step to solving any problem is to not hide from it, and the first step to any form of action is awareness. And so I decided to actually talk about race. And I decided that if I came here and shared with you some of my experiences, that maybe we could all be a little less anxious and a little more bold in our conversations about race.

Now I know there are people out there who will say that the election of Barack Obama meant that it was the end of racial discrimination for all eternity, right? But I work in the investment business, and we have a saying: The numbers do not lie. And here, there are significant, quantifiable racial disparities that cannot be ignored, in household wealth, household income, job opportunities, healthcare. One example from corporate America: Even though white men make up just 30 percent of the U.S. population, they hold 70 percent of all corporate board seats. Of the Fortune 250, there are only seven CEOs that are minorities, and of the thousands of publicly traded companies today, thousands, only two are chaired by black women, and you're looking at one of them, the same one who, not too long ago, was nearly mistaken for kitchen help. So that is a fact.

Now I have this thought experiment that I play with myself, when I say, imagine if I walked you into a room and it was of a major corporation, like ExxonMobil, and every single person around the boardroom were black, you would think that were weird. But if I walked you into a Fortune 500 company, and everyone around the table is a white male, when will it be that we think that's weird too?

And I know how we got here. You know, there was institutionalized, at one time legalized, discrimination in our country. There's no question about it. But still, as I grapple with this issue, my mother's question hangs in the air for me: How did they treat you?

Now, I do not raise this issue to complain or in any way to elicit any kind of sympathy. I have succeeded in my life beyond my wildest expectations, and I have been treated well by people of all races more often than I have not. I tell the uniform story because it happened. I cite those statistics around corporate board diversity because they are real, and I stand here today talking about this issue of racial discrimination because I believe it threatens to rob another generation of all the opportunities that all of us want for all of our children, no matter what their color or where they come from. And I think it also threatens to hold back businesses.

You see, researchers have coined this term "color blindness" to describe a learned behavior where we pretend that we don't notice race. If you happen to be surrounded by a bunch of people who look like you, that's purely accidental. Now, color blindness, in my view, doesn't mean that there's no racial discrimination, and there's fairness. It doesn't mean that at all. It doesn't ensure it. In my view, color blindness is very dangerous because it means we're ignoring the problem. There was a corporate study that said that, instead of avoiding race, the really smart corporations actually deal with it head on. They actually recognize that embracing diversity means recognizing all races, including the majority one. But I'll be the first one to tell you, this subject matter can be hard, awkward, uncomfortable — but that's kind of the point.

In the spirit of debunking racial stereotypes, the one that black people don't like to swim, I'm going to tell you how much I love to swim. I love to swim so much that as an adult, I swim with a coach. And one day my coach had me do a drill where I had to swim to one end of a 25-meter pool without taking a breath. And every single time I failed, I had to start over. And I failed a lot. By the end, I got it, but when I got out of the pool, I was exasperated and tired and annoyed, and I said, "Why are we doing breath-holding exercises?" And my coach looked me at me, and he said, "Mellody, that was not a breath-holding exercise. That drill was to make you comfortable being uncomfortable, because that's how most of us spend our days." If we can learn to deal with our discomfort, and just relax into it, we'll have a better life.

So I think it's time for us to be comfortable with the uncomfortable conversation about race: black, white, Asian, Hispanic, male, female, all of us, if we truly believe in equal rights and equal opportunity in America, I think we have to have real conversations about this issue. We cannot afford to be color blind. We have to be color brave. We have to be willing, as teachers and parents and entrepreneurs and scientists, we have to be willing to have proactive conversations about race with honesty and understanding and courage, not because it's the right thing to do, but because it's the smart thing to do, because our businesses and our products and our science, our research, all of that will be better with greater diversity.

Now, my favorite example of color bravery is a guy named John Skipper. He runs ESPN. He's a North Carolina native, quintessential Southern gentleman, white. He joined ESPN, which already had a culture of inclusion and diversity, but he took it up a notch. He demanded that every open position have a diverse slate of candidates. Now he says the senior people in the beginning bristled, and they would come to him and say, "Do you want me to hire the minority, or do you want me to hire the best person for the job?" And Skipper says his answers were always the same: "Yes." And by saying yes to diversity, I honestly believe that ESPN is the most valuable cable franchise in the world. I think that's a part of the secret sauce.

Now I can tell you, in my own industry, at Ariel Investments, we actually view our diversity as a competitive advantage, and that advantage can extend way beyond business. There's a guy named Scott Page at the University of Michigan. He is the first person to develop a mathematical calculation for diversity. He says, if you're trying to solve a really hard problem, really hard, that you should have a diverse group of people, including those with diverse intellects. The example that he gives is the smallpox epidemic. When it was ravaging Europe, they brought together all these scientists, and they were stumped. And the beginnings of the cure to the disease came from the most unlikely source, a dairy farmer who noticed that the milkmaids were not getting smallpox. And the smallpox vaccination is bovine-based because of that dairy farmer.

Now I'm sure you're sitting here and you're saying, I don't run a cable company, I don't run an investment firm, I am not a dairy farmer. What can I do? And I'm telling you, you can be color brave. If you're part of a hiring process or an admissions process, you can be color brave. If you are trying to solve a really hard problem, you can speak up and be color brave. Now I know people will say, but that doesn't add up to a lot, but I'm actually asking you to do something really simple: observe your environment, at work, at school, at home. I'm asking you to look at the people around you purposefully and intentionally. Invite people into your life who don't look like you, don't think like you, don't act like you, don't come from where you come from, and you might find that they will challenge your assumptions and make you grow as a person. You might get powerful new insights from these individuals, or, like my husband, who happens to be white, you might learn that black people, men, women, children, we use body lotion every single day.

Now, I also think that this is very important so that the next generation really understands that this progress will help them, because they're expecting us to be great role models.

Now, I told you, my mother, she was ruthlessly realistic. She was an unbelievable role model. She was the kind of person who got to be the way she was because she was a single mom with six kids in Chicago. She was in the real estate business, where she worked extraordinarily hard but oftentimes had a hard time making ends meet. And that meant sometimes we got our phone disconnected, or our lights turned off, or we got evicted. When we got evicted, sometimes we lived in these small apartments that she owned, sometimes in only one or two rooms, because they weren't completed, and we would heat our bathwater on hot plates. But she never gave up hope, ever, and she never allowed us to give up hope either. This brutal pragmatism that she had, I mean, I was four and she told me, "Mommy is Santa." She was this brutal pragmatism. She taught me so many lessons, but the most important lesson was that every single day she told me, "Mellody, you can be anything." And because of those words, I would wake up at the crack of dawn, and because of those words, I would love school more than anything, and because of those words, when I was on a bus going to school, I dreamed the biggest dreams. And it's because of those words that I stand here right now full of passion, asking you to be brave for the kids who are dreaming those dreams today.

You see, I want them to look at a CEO on television and say, "I can be like her," or, "He looks like me." And I want them to know that anything is possible, that they can achieve the highest level that they ever imagined, that they will be welcome in any corporate boardroom, or they can lead any company. You see this idea of being the land of the free and the home of the brave, it's woven into the fabric of America. America, when we have a challenge, we take it head on, we don't shrink away from it. We take a stand. We show courage. So right now, what I'm asking you to do, I'm asking you to show courage. I'm asking you to be bold. As business leaders, I'm asking you not to leave anything on the table. As citizens, I'm asking you not to leave any child behind. I'm asking you not to be color blind, but to be color brave, so that every child knows that their future matters and their dreams are possible.

Thank you.`

    fullText: `President Johnson, distinguished faculty, proud families, and the extraordinary Class of 2020 – congratulations on this momentous achievement.

It is a profound honor to address you today as graduates of Spelman College, an institution that has been a beacon of excellence for Black women for more than 140 years. You are part of a legacy that includes civil rights leaders, scientists, artists, entrepreneurs, and change-makers who have shaped our world.

But today, I want to talk to you about something that I believe is at the heart of the Spelman experience: leadership. Not the kind of leadership that requires a title or a corner office, but the kind of leadership that you can exercise right now, right where you are, with whatever resources you have.

Leadership is not about the title you hold, but about the impact you make. Lead from where you are, with what you have, for the people who need you most.

I learned this lesson the hard way. In 2018, I ran for Governor of Georgia. I had a plan, a vision, and the support of hundreds of thousands of Georgians. But I didn't win. In fact, I experienced what many would call a devastating defeat.

But here's what I learned from that experience: losing a race doesn't mean losing your voice. Failing to win an election doesn't mean failing to make a difference. Sometimes, the most important leadership happens not when you're in the position you wanted, but when you're in the position you find yourself in.

After that election, I could have retreated. I could have felt sorry for myself. I could have given up on the political process altogether. Instead, I decided to lead from where I was. I founded Fair Fight, an organization dedicated to protecting voting rights and ensuring fair elections. I wrote books, gave speeches, and worked to register voters across the country.

And you know what happened? In 2020, Georgia flipped blue for the first time in decades. We helped elect two Democratic senators and played a crucial role in electing a new president. None of that would have happened if I had waited for the "right" position or the "perfect" opportunity to lead.

That's the lesson I want to share with you today: don't wait for permission to lead. Don't wait for someone to give you a title or a platform. Don't wait until you have all the resources you think you need. Lead from where you are, right now.

You might be thinking, "But Stacey, I'm just graduating from college. I don't have any power. I don't have any influence. How can I lead?"

Let me tell you something: some of the most powerful leaders I know are people who started with nothing but a vision and a willingness to work. They didn't wait for someone to hand them a leadership role. They created their own.

Leadership is about seeing a problem and deciding to be part of the solution. It's about using your voice to speak up for those who can't speak for themselves. It's about using your talents to serve others. It's about refusing to accept injustice, inequality, or indifference.

As Spelman women, you have been trained not just to succeed, but to serve. You have been taught not just to achieve, but to lift others as you climb. That's not just a nice sentiment – it's a call to action.

The world you're entering is facing enormous challenges. We're dealing with a global pandemic that has exposed deep inequalities in our society. We're grappling with systemic racism that continues to deny opportunities to millions of Americans. We're facing climate change, economic uncertainty, and threats to our democracy.

These challenges can seem overwhelming. But I want you to see them as opportunities – opportunities to lead, to make a difference, to be part of the solution.

You don't need to solve all of these problems by yourself. But you can choose one issue that matters to you and commit to making a difference. You can use your education, your passion, and your voice to create change.

Maybe you'll become a doctor and work to eliminate health disparities in underserved communities. Maybe you'll become a teacher and help close the achievement gap. Maybe you'll become an entrepreneur and create jobs in communities that need them most. Maybe you'll become an activist and fight for justice and equality.

Whatever path you choose, remember this: your leadership matters. Your voice matters. Your contribution matters.

But leadership isn't just about what you do professionally. It's about how you show up in your community, in your family, in your relationships. It's about being the person who speaks up when others are silent. It's about being the person who stands up when others sit down. It's about being the person who shows up when others turn away.

I want to share with you three principles that have guided my own leadership journey:

First, embrace your authenticity. Don't try to be the leader you think others want you to be. Be the leader you are meant to be. Your unique perspective, your experiences, your background – these are not obstacles to overcome, they are assets to leverage.

As Black women, we often feel pressure to conform, to fit in, to make others comfortable. But the world doesn't need another copy of someone else. It needs the original you. Your authenticity is your superpower.

Second, build bridges, not walls. Leadership is not about defeating your opponents; it's about finding common ground and building coalitions. It's about bringing people together around shared values and shared goals.

This doesn't mean compromising your principles. It means being principled enough to work with others who share your commitment to progress, even if you disagree on some of the details.

Third, turn your setbacks into comebacks. You will face failures, disappointments, and defeats. That's not a sign that you're not meant to lead – it's a sign that you're human. What matters is not whether you fall, but whether you get back up.

Every setback is an opportunity to learn, to grow, to come back stronger. Every defeat is a chance to reassess, to refocus, to recommit to your goals.

I want you to remember that your education at Spelman has prepared you not just for success, but for significance. You have been trained to think critically, to communicate effectively, to solve problems creatively. But most importantly, you have been taught to care – about justice, about equality, about making the world a better place.

That caring is what will drive your leadership. That passion is what will sustain you through the challenges ahead. That commitment is what will enable you to make a lasting impact.

As you leave this institution and enter the next phase of your lives, remember that you carry with you the hopes and dreams of all the women who came before you – the women who fought for the right to vote, the right to an education, the right to be treated with dignity and respect.

You also carry with you the responsibility to open doors for the women who will come after you. Your success is not just about you – it's about all of us.

The world needs your leadership. It needs your energy, your ideas, your passion for justice. It needs your willingness to challenge the status quo and fight for what's right.

Don't wait for someone to give you permission to lead. Don't wait for the perfect opportunity or the ideal circumstances. Lead from where you are, with what you have, starting today.

The future is not something that happens to you – it's something you create. And I have no doubt that you will create a future that is more just, more equitable, and more hopeful than the world you inherited.

Congratulations, Class of 2020. Now go out there and lead.

Thank you.`

It is an honor to be here with you today at UCLA, an institution that has been a launching pad for so many creative minds and innovative thinkers. As I look out at all of you, I see the future of storytelling, the future of media, the future of how we understand and share the human experience.

Today, I want to talk to you about something that I believe is fundamental to who we are as human beings: our stories. Your story matters. Your voice matters. Your perspective is needed. Don't wait for permission to tell your story – create your own opportunities.

When I started my career, I didn't set out to become a filmmaker. I was working in journalism and public relations, and I was good at it. But I felt like something was missing. I felt like the stories I really wanted to tell – stories about people who looked like me, stories about experiences that weren't being represented in mainstream media – those stories weren't being told.

So I made a choice. I decided to stop waiting for someone else to tell those stories and start telling them myself. I took my life savings, bought a camera, and made my first film. It wasn't perfect. It wasn't polished. But it was mine, and it was authentic, and it was necessary.

That film led to another, and another, and eventually to "Selma," "13th," "When They See Us," and "A Wrinkle in Time." But none of that would have happened if I had waited for permission, if I had waited for someone to give me an opportunity, if I had waited for the industry to change.

The lesson I want to share with you today is this: don't wait. Don't wait for the perfect moment, the perfect opportunity, the perfect circumstances. Don't wait for someone to validate your vision or give you permission to pursue your dreams. Create your own opportunities.

In the film industry, I was told for years that stories about Black people, stories about women, stories about social justice – these stories wouldn't sell. They wouldn't find an audience. They weren't commercial. They weren't universal.

But I knew that was wrong. I knew that everyone's story is universal when it's told with truth and authenticity. I knew that representation matters, not just for the people being represented, but for everyone who gets to see and understand different perspectives.

When "Selma" was released, it wasn't just important for Black audiences to see their history reflected on screen. It was important for all audiences to understand that history, to grapple with its implications, to see how it connects to our present moment.

When "13th" explored the intersection of race and mass incarceration, it wasn't just a film for people who already understood these issues. It was a film that opened eyes, changed minds, and sparked conversations that needed to happen.

When "When They See Us" told the story of the Central Park Five, it wasn't just about correcting a historical injustice. It was about showing how the media, the justice system, and society as a whole can fail the most vulnerable among us.

These stories mattered because they were true, because they were necessary, and because they were told with integrity and purpose. But they also mattered because they changed the conversation about what kinds of stories deserve to be told and who deserves to tell them.

That's the power of storytelling. It's not just entertainment. It's not just art. It's a tool for understanding, for empathy, for social change. It's a way to make the invisible visible, to give voice to the voiceless, to challenge assumptions and change hearts and minds.

But here's the thing: that power doesn't belong only to filmmakers or writers or journalists. It belongs to all of you. Every single one of you has a story to tell, a perspective to share, a voice that needs to be heard.

Maybe you're going into business, and your story is about creating companies that prioritize social responsibility and ethical practices. Maybe you're going into medicine, and your story is about providing healthcare to underserved communities. Maybe you're going into education, and your story is about ensuring that every child has access to quality learning opportunities.

Whatever field you enter, whatever career you pursue, you have the opportunity to tell your story through your work, through your choices, through the impact you make on the world.

But telling your story isn't just about your professional life. It's about how you show up in the world every day. It's about the conversations you have, the relationships you build, the communities you serve. It's about being authentic, being honest, being true to your values and your vision.

In a world that often tries to silence certain voices, that tries to marginalize certain perspectives, that tries to make certain people invisible, your commitment to telling your story is an act of resistance. It's an act of courage. It's an act of love.

I want to share with you three principles that have guided my own storytelling journey:

First, authenticity is your superpower. Don't try to tell the stories you think people want to hear. Tell the stories that you need to tell. Tell the stories that come from your heart, your experience, your truth. Those are the stories that will resonate, that will matter, that will make a difference.

Second, representation is revolution. When you tell stories that haven't been told, when you center voices that have been marginalized, when you challenge the dominant narrative, you're not just making art – you're making change. You're expanding the definition of whose stories matter, whose experiences count, whose voices deserve to be heard.

Third, collaboration amplifies impact. Storytelling is not a solo endeavor. The best stories come from bringing together diverse perspectives, different talents, varied experiences. Surround yourself with people who challenge you, who complement your skills, who share your commitment to truth and justice.

As you leave UCLA and enter the next phase of your lives, I want you to remember that you are living in an unprecedented time for storytelling. Technology has democratized the tools of creation and distribution. Social media has given everyone a platform. Streaming services have created new opportunities for diverse content.

But with that opportunity comes responsibility. The stories you tell, the content you create, the messages you share – they have power. They can heal or harm, unite or divide, inspire or discourage. Use that power wisely.

Tell stories that matter. Tell stories that challenge. Tell stories that inspire. Tell stories that bring us together rather than tear us apart. Tell stories that help us understand each other better, that help us see our common humanity, that help us build a more just and equitable world.

Your generation has the opportunity to reshape how stories are told, who gets to tell them, and what impact they have on society. You have the opportunity to create a media landscape that truly reflects the diversity and complexity of human experience.

But that won't happen automatically. It will happen because you make it happen. It will happen because you refuse to accept the status quo. It will happen because you insist on telling your story, even when others try to silence you.

The world needs your stories. It needs your perspective. It needs your voice. It needs your commitment to truth, to justice, to representation, to change.

Don't wait for permission. Don't wait for an invitation. Don't wait for the perfect moment. Start telling your story today. Start with where you are, with what you have, with the platform you can create for yourself.

Your story matters. Your voice matters. Your perspective is needed.

Now go out there and tell it.

Congratulations, Class of 2018. The world is waiting to hear from you.

Thank you.`

    fullText: `President Frederick, distinguished faculty, proud families, and the graduating class of 2017 – it is an extraordinary honor to stand before you today at this sacred institution.

Howard University is not just a school. It is a sanctuary. It is a place where Black minds have been nurtured, Black voices have been amplified, and Black dreams have been realized for more than 150 years. You are part of that legacy, and that legacy is now part of you.

Today, I want to talk to you about something that has shaped my life and my understanding of the world: the power of writing. But I'm not just talking about writing as a craft or a profession. I'm talking about writing as an act of courage, as a tool for truth-telling, as a weapon against ignorance and injustice.

Writing is an act of courage. It requires you to be vulnerable, to tell the truth, and to confront uncomfortable realities. But it's through this courage that we create change.

When I was your age, I was not a good student. I was angry, unfocused, and frankly, I didn't see the point of much of what I was being taught. I dropped out of Howard – yes, this very institution – because I thought I knew better. I thought the world owed me something, and I was impatient to collect.

But life has a way of humbling you, of teaching you lessons you didn't know you needed to learn. And one of the most important lessons I learned was this: education is not just about acquiring knowledge. It's about acquiring the tools to think critically, to question assumptions, to see the world as it really is, not as we wish it were.

It was through writing that I began to understand this. Writing forced me to slow down, to think carefully about what I believed and why I believed it. Writing forced me to confront my own ignorance, my own biases, my own limitations.

But writing also gave me power. It gave me the power to articulate my thoughts, to share my experiences, to contribute to important conversations about race, history, and justice in America.

When I wrote "Between the World and Me," I wasn't trying to write a bestseller or win awards. I was trying to make sense of my own experience as a Black man in America. I was trying to understand how the history of this country had shaped my life and the lives of people who looked like me.

But what I discovered in the process of writing that book was that my personal story was connected to a much larger story – the story of how race has been constructed and used in America, the story of how violence and exploitation have been justified and normalized, the story of how people have resisted and survived and thrived despite it all.

That's the power of writing: it allows us to connect our individual experiences to larger truths, to see patterns and systems that might otherwise remain invisible, to bear witness to realities that others might prefer to ignore.

But writing is not just about individual expression. It's about collective understanding. It's about creating a record, preserving memory, challenging dominant narratives.

For too long, the stories that have been told about Black people in America have been told by others, from the outside, often with little understanding or empathy. But when we tell our own stories, when we write our own narratives, when we insist on our own humanity and complexity, we change the conversation.

This is especially important for you as graduates of Howard University. You have been educated at an institution that has always understood the importance of Black intellectual life, Black scholarship, Black voices. You have been taught not just to consume knowledge, but to create it, to question it, to add to it.

As you leave this place and enter the world, you will encounter people who will try to diminish your intelligence, question your qualifications, dismiss your perspectives. You will encounter systems and structures that were not designed with you in mind, that may actively work against your success.

But you have something powerful: you have your voice, your perspective, your ability to think critically and write clearly about the world as you see it.

Use that power. Write about your experiences. Write about the injustices you see. Write about the beauty you find. Write about the questions that keep you up at night. Write about the solutions you envision.

Don't wait for permission. Don't wait for someone to give you a platform. Create your own platform. Start a blog. Write for your local newspaper. Submit articles to magazines. Apply for fellowships. Pitch book ideas. Use social media to share your thoughts and engage in important conversations.

But remember: with the power to write comes the responsibility to write well, to write truthfully, to write with integrity. Don't just write to confirm what people already believe. Write to challenge, to complicate, to illuminate.

Be willing to be wrong. Be willing to change your mind. Be willing to admit when you don't know something. The best writers are not those who have all the answers, but those who ask the right questions.

And remember that writing is not just about individual success. It's about contributing to a larger project of understanding, of justice, of human flourishing. When you write, you're not just expressing yourself – you're participating in the ongoing conversation about who we are as a society, where we've been, and where we're going.

The world needs your voices now more than ever. We live in an age of information overload, of fake news, of echo chambers and filter bubbles. We need writers who can cut through the noise, who can help us make sense of complexity, who can remind us of our shared humanity.

We need writers who can help us understand how the past shapes the present, how individual experiences connect to larger systems, how we can work together to create a more just and equitable future.

You have been trained for this work. You have been given the tools – intellectual, analytical, creative – to contribute to this vital project. Don't waste those tools. Don't underestimate your own power.

But also remember that writing is hard work. It requires discipline, persistence, and humility. It requires you to read widely, to think deeply, to revise constantly. It requires you to be open to criticism, to learn from failure, to keep going even when the words don't come easily.

Most importantly, it requires you to care – about truth, about justice, about the people whose stories you're telling, about the readers who will encounter your work.

As you leave Howard and begin the next chapter of your lives, I want you to remember that you are part of a tradition of Black intellectual excellence that stretches back generations. You are the inheritors of a legacy of scholarship, activism, and artistic achievement that has changed the world.

But you are not just inheritors – you are creators. You have the opportunity to add your own voices to this tradition, to tell new stories, to ask new questions, to imagine new possibilities.

The pen is in your hands. The page is before you. The world is waiting to hear what you have to say.

Write with courage. Write with conviction. Write with love.

And remember: your words have power. Use them wisely.

Congratulations, Class of 2017. Now go out there and write your way to freedom.

Thank you.`

    fullText: `Dean Gillian Lester, distinguished faculty, proud families, and the graduating class of 2019 – congratulations on this momentous achievement.

It is a profound honor to address you today at Columbia Law School, an institution that has trained generations of lawyers, judges, and advocates who have shaped our legal system and our society. As you prepare to enter the legal profession, I want to talk to you about something that I believe is fundamental to the pursuit of justice: intersectionality.

Justice is not just about individual achievement, but about collective liberation. We must understand how different forms of discrimination intersect and work together to create systemic inequality.

When I first coined the term "intersectionality" more than thirty years ago, I was trying to address a simple but profound problem: the law's failure to see and address the unique discrimination faced by Black women. The courts could see race discrimination. They could see sex discrimination. But they couldn't see what happened when both forms of discrimination came together to create something distinct and particularly harmful.

This wasn't just an academic exercise. This was about real people – Black women who were being denied jobs, who were facing harassment, who were being excluded from opportunities – and who had no legal recourse because their experiences didn't fit neatly into the existing categories of discrimination law.

But intersectionality is about more than just Black women, and it's about more than just race and gender. It's a framework for understanding how all of our identities – our race, our gender, our class, our sexuality, our disability status, our immigration status – interact with systems of power to shape our experiences in the world.

It's about recognizing that people are not just one thing. We are complex, multifaceted beings who exist at the intersection of multiple identities and multiple systems of oppression and privilege.

And here's why this matters for you as future lawyers: the law has tremendous power to either perpetuate inequality or to challenge it. The legal frameworks we create, the cases we bring, the arguments we make – they all have the potential to either see people in their full complexity or to reduce them to single dimensions.

For too long, our legal system has operated from a single-axis framework – looking at discrimination one category at a time, addressing inequality one issue at a time, seeking justice one group at a time. But that approach leaves too many people behind. It leaves behind the people who exist at the intersections, who face multiple forms of discrimination simultaneously, who don't fit neatly into our existing legal categories.

As you enter the legal profession, I want to challenge you to think differently. I want you to develop what I call "intersectional literacy" – the ability to see and understand how different forms of inequality work together, how they reinforce each other, how they create unique harms that require unique solutions.

This means asking different questions. Instead of just asking "Is this race discrimination or sex discrimination?" ask "How do race and gender work together in this situation?" Instead of just asking "How do we protect this particular group?" ask "How do we create systems that protect everyone, especially those who face multiple forms of marginalization?"

This means thinking beyond individual cases to systemic change. Yes, it's important to win individual cases, to get justice for individual clients. But it's also important to think about how those cases fit into larger patterns, how they can be used to challenge broader systems of inequality.

This means building coalitions across difference. Intersectionality is not about dividing people into smaller and smaller groups. It's about understanding how our struggles are connected, how our liberation is bound together, how we can work across our differences to create change.

Let me give you a concrete example. When we talk about police violence, we often focus on the experiences of Black men. And that's important – Black men do face disproportionate levels of police violence, and that's a serious problem that deserves attention.

But if we only focus on Black men, we miss the experiences of Black women who are also victims of police violence – women like Sandra Bland, Breonna Taylor, Atatiana Jefferson. We miss the ways that Black women's experiences of police violence are shaped not just by their race, but also by their gender, by stereotypes about Black women's sexuality and aggression, by the particular ways that Black women are policed and controlled.

The #SayHerName campaign that I helped launch was designed to address this gap, to make visible the experiences of Black women and girls who are victims of police violence. It was an intersectional intervention – an attempt to expand our understanding of police violence to include all of its victims.

But intersectionality is not just about understanding oppression. It's also about understanding privilege, about recognizing how some of us benefit from systems that harm others, about using that privilege responsibly.

Many of you in this room have significant privilege. You're graduating from one of the most prestigious law schools in the country. You'll have opportunities that many people can only dream of. You'll have access to power, to resources, to platforms that can be used to create change.

The question is: how will you use that privilege? Will you use it only to advance your own interests, or will you use it to challenge systems of inequality? Will you use it to climb the ladder and then pull it up behind you, or will you use it to create more ladders for others to climb?

Intersectionality demands that we think about privilege and oppression not as fixed categories, but as dynamic relationships that shift depending on context. You might be privileged in some ways and marginalized in others. You might have power in some situations and be powerless in others.

The key is to be aware of these dynamics, to be thoughtful about how you navigate them, to be intentional about using whatever privilege you have to create more justice, more equality, more opportunity for others.

As lawyers, you will have many opportunities to make these choices. You'll choose which cases to take, which clients to represent, which causes to support. You'll choose how to frame legal arguments, how to tell stories in court, how to use the law as a tool for change.

I encourage you to make those choices with an intersectional lens. Ask yourself: whose voices are being heard? Whose experiences are being centered? Whose stories are being told? And whose voices, experiences, and stories are being left out?

Ask yourself: how can I use my legal training not just to succeed within existing systems, but to challenge and transform those systems? How can I use the law not just to protect the privileged, but to empower the marginalized?

These are not easy questions, and they don't have simple answers. Intersectional thinking requires nuance, complexity, a willingness to sit with ambiguity and contradiction. It requires us to move beyond either/or thinking to both/and thinking.

But I believe that this kind of thinking is essential if we want to create a more just society. We cannot address inequality by looking at one form of discrimination at a time. We cannot achieve justice by focusing on one group at a time. We need approaches that are as complex and multifaceted as the problems we're trying to solve.

The legal profession needs lawyers who can think intersectionally, who can see connections across difference, who can build coalitions for change. The world needs advocates who understand that justice is not a zero-sum game, that liberation for some does not require oppression of others, that we can create systems that work for everyone.

You have the tools, the training, and the opportunity to be those lawyers, those advocates, those change-makers. You have the privilege of a Columbia Law degree, and with that privilege comes responsibility.

Use your legal training to challenge injustice wherever you find it. Use your voice to speak up for those who have been silenced. Use your privilege to create opportunities for others. Use your power to build a more just and equitable world.

The law is not neutral. It is not objective. It is a human creation that reflects human choices, human values, human priorities. And that means it can be changed. It can be improved. It can be made more just.

But that will only happen if people like you – people with legal training, with access to power, with the ability to shape legal discourse – choose to make it happen.

The future of justice depends on your choices. Choose wisely. Choose courageously. Choose with an intersectional lens that sees and values the full complexity of human experience.

Congratulations, Class of 2019. Now go out there and use the law to create the world you want to live in.

Thank you.`

    fullText: `Thank you for this honor. When I first arrived in the robing room I had to figure out who was the president and the chancellor, and they were the ones wearing the most bling. I was invited to give the commencement speech and they said I would have 8 minutes, I said the universe needs more than eight minutes. I need at least nine minutes. Maybe ten.

I thought I would spend this time, brief as it is, together, things that you should know going forward in life. Maybe you already know it, but I don't think everybody knows all of this.

Your grades. Whatever is your GPA rapidly becomes irrelevant in your life. I cannot begin to impress upon you how irrelevant it becomes. Ask anybody just a few years older than you "When was the last time someone asked about your GPA?" And they will have long forgotten, because in life they're not gonna ask you your GPA. They will ask you "are you a hard worker?" "Are you a problem solver?" "Are you committed?" "Are you a good leader?" All of these other questions matter in the rest of your life.

I remember taking the SATs long ago. I remember I got the scores back and my verbal score was ok, but it wasn't one of those scores where a teacher will say "hey he'll go far, watch that student!" So a few years go by, I get my masters, my PHD, I write a column for a magazine... 5 books later I get a letter from the educational testing service in New Jersey. They are the purveyors of the SATs.

I get the letter saying "Gasp, was there an error in my SAT scores?!" I'm a full grown adult reacting this way to a letter. And I open it up and they said "Dear Dr. Tyson, we were reading one of your essays on the universe, and we were impressed with it so much we want to use it for the next round of SATs for the reading comprehension part for the students." So I said "What just happened here!? Something is wrong!"

If the exam means anything, if your GPA means anything, it's that you were in that moment and it so does not define you for the rest of your life.

Another thing- the most dangerous people in a free society are those who don't know- by the way it's ok to not know! This is what school is for! That's ok! But if you don't know, but think you do know, and have power over legislation that would affect others, THAT is dangerous. Those are the signs of the end of an informed democracy.

Science matters. Other subjects matter too, but I'm just saying, science matters in the following way. Think about it. Cavemen and women: they had clean air, freshwater, their food was free range, organic, and their life expectancy was thirty five!

Something else that matters that improves your life expectancy than just the search for clean air and clean water! There's more going on in our lives, brought to you by innovations in science and technology, that improves your health, your wealth, your well-being, just consider that before you start saying "I don't like science, I don't want science" Then move the hell back into the cave and we'll go to your funeral before you turn 36!

Another thing- It's become a past-time to blame politicians for the ills of the world. And I understand the urge to do that, I get that, however, at the end of the day, the politician is a representative of an electorate.

If you have an issue with the politicians that means you have an issue with your fellow citizens that put them there! So if there is a politician that is SURE that the universe is 6,000 years old, It's because there are people walking among us that think that.

As an educator it is my duty to teach people about the methods and tools of science- how and why it works, because the engines of tomorrow's economy depends on it. Innovations in science and technology will drive the 21st century economies. The extent to which you cherry pick science for your own philosophy, just because you didn't like the result- where does it stop! What's gonna happen, you're gonna say "I want to repeal the law of gravity because I gained ten pounds last month!" Where does it stop!

The laws of physics affect us all! Objective truths are true whether or not you believe in them. So if you are not scientifically literate in the 21st century, you will have disenfranchised yourself from important decisions that affect us all. Unless you're ok with that, you should be thinking about how to learn- it doesn't mean you have to be a scientist, no you don't have to be one, just understand what it is, and why!

Scientific literacy is not how much you know, it's how your brain is wired for thought. If someone comes up to you and says "I have these crystals, and if you rub them together and dance under them, it'll cure your ailments." Ok so now, it's easy to be smug and say this person is a freaking idiot, let me just leave them alone.

One might also say "Wow that's great lemme get them, how much are they, I'll buy all of them!" Do you realize each of those states of mind are equally as lazy. It actually takes effort to inquire about the truth of something. Effort. So you ask "Where are these crystals from? What are they made of? What's their chemical composition? What are the properties you're evoking that claims to create the health? What're the experiments, can you cite them?"

That is science literacy. Neither the blunt acceptance or blunt rejection of a claim of someone who is making statements in the name of science.

Another point- this is a personal thing- I think on some level role models are overrated. Let me tell you why.

Growing up in the Bronx- Had I acquired a prerequisite that another black man from the Bronx had become an astrophysicist, I'd still be in the Bronx. If you acquire a role model who looks just like you to be something you wanna be, and you can't find one, is that a reason to not be what you want to be? No!

My argument is simple. You could assemble your role model- get the people that do what you like, but you don't have to be them! Be the piece of them that you want to be, and if it's someone who was moral, do that, someone athletic, do that. You don't have to be the whole person. That protects you from when your person messes up in some fundamental way, there is not this fear that you have to mess up too, because that's what your role model did.

So I encourage people to assemble their role models ala carte. That is a far more potent way to establish what it is you want to become in this world.

Now a couple things just cosmically. The universe is bigger than you are. Lesson one. It sounds obvious, but some people don't really know that. Number two, Earth. If someone invites you to go to Mars, just remember how beautiful Earth is before you do that. You can breathe the air, you know, things like this, however. Do not forget that Earth is really good at killing. Over ninety seven percent of all the species of life on earth that have ever existed are now extinct because of Earth. So we think of Earth as a haven, but in fact it is out to kill us every opportunity it gets. It's our ingenuity in spite of that fact that prevents it.

And the sun, is a limitless source of energy. Oil under the ground, not so much. If you want us to exist and thrive into the future, and you're one of these people that say "I don't need space, I'll solve all my problems here on earth" meanwhile there's unlimited energy, unlimited resources, move back to the cave because that's where you'll be when this is all over.

My final point. We live in a world where not everyone has the urge to help others. Ok? Wanna do it all yourself for yourself, and require that other people help themselves, and I'm reminded of a saying that went around for awhile they say "We need people to lift themselves up by their bootstraps". And then I think about that, and that works you know, sometimes, but we're reminded that it is ok to encourage others to pull themselves up by the bootstraps. But if you do just remember that some people have no boots.

Thank you.`

    fullText: `Vice-Chancellor, distinguished faculty, proud families, and the graduating class of 2019 – congratulations on this remarkable achievement.

It is a great honor to address you today at the University of Lagos, one of Nigeria's most prestigious institutions. As I look out at all of you, I see the future of Africa. I see young minds that will shape our continent's destiny and build the Africa we all dream of.

Today, I want to talk to you about something I am deeply passionate about: building Africa's future. Africa has everything it needs to succeed. We have the resources, the people, and the potential. What we need is the vision, the patience, and the discipline to build sustainable businesses that will transform our continent.

When I started my business journey over four decades ago, many people told me that Africa was not ready for big business. They said our markets were too small, our infrastructure too weak, our people too poor. But I believed then, as I believe now, that Africa is the land of opportunity.

I started with a small trading business, importing sugar, rice, and cement. People laughed at my ambitions when I said I wanted to build the largest industrial conglomerate in Africa. They said it was impossible, that an African company could never compete with multinational corporations.

But I had a vision. I saw an Africa where we would not just be consumers of products made elsewhere, but producers of goods that would feed our people, build our cities, and power our economies. I saw an Africa where our young people would have opportunities to build careers, start businesses, and create wealth right here on our continent.

That vision drove me through many challenges. There were times when I almost gave up, when the obstacles seemed insurmountable, when the critics seemed to be right. But I learned that success in Africa requires three things: vision, patience, and discipline.

Vision is about seeing possibilities where others see problems. When I looked at Africa's growing population, I didn't see a burden – I saw a market. When I looked at our lack of local production, I didn't see a weakness – I saw an opportunity. When I looked at our young people, I didn't see unemployment – I saw untapped potential.

But vision alone is not enough. You need patience. Building sustainable businesses in Africa takes time. You cannot expect overnight success. You must be willing to invest for the long term, to build slowly and steadily, to weather the storms and keep moving forward.

I spent decades building my business, reinvesting profits, expanding gradually, learning from mistakes. Many times, I could have taken shortcuts, made quick profits, and moved my money elsewhere. But I believed in Africa's potential, and I was patient enough to wait for that potential to be realized.

And you need discipline. Discipline to focus on what matters most. Discipline to resist the temptation of easy money. Discipline to build quality products and services. Discipline to treat your employees, customers, and communities with respect.

In business, there are always opportunities to cut corners, to compromise on quality, to prioritize short-term profits over long-term sustainability. But if you want to build something lasting, something that will contribute to Africa's development, you must have the discipline to do things the right way.

Today, the Dangote Group employs over 30,000 people across Africa. We produce cement that builds homes, schools, and hospitals. We refine oil that powers our economies. We produce fertilizer that feeds our people. We are building a petrochemical complex that will make Nigeria self-sufficient in many products we currently import.

But this is not just about one company or one man's success. This is about what is possible when we believe in Africa, when we invest in Africa, when we build for Africa.

As you leave this university and enter the next phase of your lives, I want to challenge you to think about how you can contribute to building Africa's future. You don't all need to become entrepreneurs, but you all need to become builders – builders of institutions, builders of communities, builders of a better Africa.

If you choose the path of entrepreneurship, remember that business is not just about making money. Business is about solving problems, creating value, providing jobs, and contributing to society. Look for problems that need solving in your communities, in your countries, in your continent. Those problems are your opportunities.

Don't be afraid to start small. Every big business started with a small idea, a small investment, a small step. What matters is that you start, that you learn, that you persist, and that you grow.

Don't be discouraged by those who say Africa is not ready, that our markets are too difficult, that success is impossible. I have heard these arguments for forty years, and I have proven them wrong. You can prove them wrong too.

Invest in yourself. Invest in your education, your skills, your network. The world is changing rapidly, and you need to change with it. Technology is creating new opportunities every day. Artificial intelligence, renewable energy, digital finance, e-commerce – these are the industries that will shape Africa's future.

But also remember your roots. Remember the communities that raised you, the countries that educated you, the continent that gave you opportunities. As you succeed, lift others with you. Create jobs for your fellow Africans. Mentor young entrepreneurs. Invest in education and healthcare. Give back to your communities.

Africa is rising, but we need you to help it rise faster and higher. We need you to build the businesses that will make us self-sufficient. We need you to create the innovations that will solve our challenges. We need you to develop the leaders who will govern us wisely.

The world is watching Africa. They see our young population, our natural resources, our growing economies. Some see opportunities to exploit. Others see partners to work with. But what they all see is potential – the potential for Africa to become a major force in the global economy.

That potential will only be realized if we have the courage to dream big, the patience to build sustainably, and the discipline to do things right. It will only be realized if we believe in ourselves, invest in ourselves, and work together to build the Africa we want to see.

You are the generation that will make this happen. You have better education than any generation before you. You have access to technology that can connect you to the world. You have opportunities that your parents could only dream of.

But with opportunity comes responsibility. The responsibility to work hard, to think big, to act with integrity, and to never forget where you come from.

Africa's time is now. Your time is now. Go out there and build the future we all believe in.

Congratulations, Class of 2019. Make Africa proud.

Thank you.`

    fullText: `Vice-Chancellor Phakeng, distinguished faculty, proud families, and the exceptional graduating class of 2021 – congratulations on this extraordinary achievement.

It is a tremendous honor to address you today at the University of Cape Town, one of Africa's leading institutions of higher learning. As the first African and first woman to serve as Director-General of the World Trade Organization, I stand before you as proof that Africa's time has come, and that our continent is ready to take its rightful place in the global economy.

Today, I want to talk to you about something that is close to my heart: leading Africa's economic transformation. Africa must take control of its own economic destiny. We have the talent, the resources, and the determination to build a prosperous continent. But we must work together, trade with each other, and invest in our people.

For too long, Africa has been seen as a continent of problems – poverty, conflict, disease, corruption. But I see a different Africa. I see a continent of solutions, a continent of opportunities, a continent of unlimited potential.

Africa has 60% of the world's uncultivated arable land. We have 30% of the world's mineral reserves. We have the youngest population in the world, with a median age of just 19 years. We have a growing middle class, expanding cities, and increasing connectivity.

But most importantly, we have you – educated, ambitious, globally connected young Africans who refuse to accept the status quo and are determined to build a better future.

The question is: how do we transform this potential into prosperity? How do we move from being exporters of raw materials to producers of finished goods? How do we create jobs for our young people? How do we build economies that work for everyone?

The answer lies in economic transformation, and that transformation must be led by Africans, for Africans.

First, we must embrace regional integration and intra-African trade. For too long, we have traded more with the rest of the world than with each other. A farmer in Kenya finds it easier to export coffee to Europe than to sell it to a neighboring African country. A manufacturer in South Africa finds it cheaper to import goods from Asia than to buy them from other African countries.

This must change. The African Continental Free Trade Area, which launched in 2021, is our opportunity to change this narrative. It creates a single market of 1.3 billion people with a combined GDP of over $3 trillion. It has the potential to boost intra-African trade by 52% and lift 30 million people out of extreme poverty.

But trade agreements are just pieces of paper unless we have the infrastructure, the institutions, and the political will to make them work. We need better roads, railways, and ports to connect our markets. We need harmonized standards and regulations to facilitate trade. We need payment systems that allow businesses to transact across borders easily.

Second, we must invest in our people. Africa's greatest asset is not our oil, our gold, or our diamonds – it's our people. But we can only realize this potential if we invest in education, healthcare, and skills development.

We need education systems that prepare our young people for the jobs of the future, not the jobs of the past. We need to embrace technology and digital skills. We need to promote science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. We need to ensure that girls and women have equal access to education and opportunities.

When I was growing up in Nigeria, my parents invested everything in my education. They believed that education was the key to a better future, and they were right. Education opened doors for me that would have remained closed otherwise. It gave me the confidence to compete on the global stage and the skills to succeed.

But education is not just about individual success – it's about national development. Countries that invest in education grow faster, innovate more, and create more opportunities for their people.

Third, we must harness the power of technology and innovation. Africa has already shown what's possible with mobile money, which started in Kenya and has now spread across the continent. We have young entrepreneurs creating solutions to African problems using African ingenuity.

But we need to do more. We need to invest in research and development. We need to create innovation hubs and technology parks. We need to support startups and small businesses. We need to ensure that our young people have access to the internet and digital tools.

The COVID-19 pandemic showed us both our vulnerabilities and our capabilities. It exposed the weaknesses in our healthcare systems and supply chains. But it also showed our resilience, our ability to adapt, and our capacity for innovation.

African scientists were among the first to sequence the genome of the virus. African entrepreneurs created innovative solutions for contact tracing, telemedicine, and e-learning. African governments implemented creative policies to support their people and economies.

This is the Africa I know – an Africa that doesn't wait for solutions from outside but creates its own solutions to its own problems.

Fourth, we must ensure that women are full participants in our economic transformation. Study after study shows that countries with greater gender equality grow faster and are more prosperous. Companies with more women in leadership positions perform better. Families where women have economic power are healthier and more educated.

Yet across Africa, women still face barriers to education, employment, and entrepreneurship. They have less access to credit, land, and technology. They are underrepresented in leadership positions in business and government.

This is not just unfair – it's economically inefficient. We cannot afford to waste half of our talent. We cannot achieve our full potential if we exclude women from full participation in our economies.

As African women, we must support each other, mentor each other, and create opportunities for each other. As African men, you must be allies in this struggle for equality. As African leaders, we must create policies and institutions that promote gender equality.

Fifth, we must build strong institutions and good governance. Economic transformation requires predictable rules, transparent processes, and accountable leadership. Investors – both domestic and foreign – need to know that their investments will be protected, that contracts will be enforced, and that corruption will not undermine their efforts.

This is not just about government – it's about all of our institutions. We need strong universities that produce world-class research. We need independent judiciaries that uphold the rule of law. We need free media that hold leaders accountable. We need civil society organizations that advocate for citizens' rights.

Finally, we must tell our own stories. For too long, others have told the story of Africa – often focusing on our challenges rather than our achievements, our problems rather than our potential.

But we know the real Africa. We know the Africa of innovation and entrepreneurship. We know the Africa of rich cultures and diverse traditions. We know the Africa of resilience and hope.

As you leave this university and take your place in the world, you have a responsibility to tell the true story of Africa. Use your voices, your platforms, your networks to change the narrative about our continent.

Show the world that Africa is not a continent waiting to be saved – it's a continent ready to lead. Show them that we are not just consumers of technology – we are creators of innovation. Show them that we are not just recipients of aid – we are partners in development.

The world needs what Africa has to offer. We have the energy, the creativity, and the determination to solve some of the world's biggest challenges. Climate change, food security, healthcare, education – these are global challenges that require African solutions.

But we must believe in ourselves first. We must invest in ourselves first. We must work together first.

You are graduating at a pivotal moment in Africa's history. The decisions you make, the careers you choose, the businesses you build, the leaders you become – these will shape Africa's future for generations to come.

The Africa of your children and grandchildren depends on what you do today. Will it be an Africa of prosperity and opportunity? Will it be an Africa that has taken control of its own destiny? Will it be an Africa that is respected and admired around the world?

I believe the answer is yes, but only if you make it so.

Go out there and lead Africa's economic transformation. Build the businesses that will create jobs. Develop the innovations that will solve problems. Create the institutions that will serve our people. Tell the stories that will change perceptions.

Africa's time is now. Your time is now.

Congratulations, Class of 2021. Make Africa proud.

Thank you.`

    fullText: `President Ricciardone, distinguished faculty, proud families, and the graduating class of 2018 – congratulations on this significant milestone.

It is an honor to address you today at the American University in Cairo, an institution that has been bridging cultures and building leaders for over a century. As someone who has spent decades working across Africa and the Middle East, I understand the unique position you occupy as graduates of this remarkable institution.

Today, I want to talk to you about something that is fundamental to Africa's future: leadership and governance. Good governance is not a luxury for Africa – it is a necessity. We cannot achieve sustainable development without accountable leadership, transparent institutions, and the rule of law.

I have spent my career building businesses, creating jobs, and working to improve governance across Africa. Through the Mo Ibrahim Foundation, we have been measuring and promoting good governance for over fifteen years. What I have learned is this: governance matters more than anything else for a country's development.

You can have all the natural resources in the world, but without good governance, they become a curse rather than a blessing. You can have the most educated population, but without good governance, talent will flee to other countries. You can have the best development plans, but without good governance, they will remain on paper.

Africa has made tremendous progress in recent decades. We have seen economic growth, poverty reduction, improvements in health and education, and the emergence of a vibrant civil society. But we have also seen too many examples of poor governance holding back progress and squandering opportunities.

When I started Celtel, my telecommunications company, in the 1990s, many people told me I was crazy to invest in Africa. They said the continent was too risky, too corrupt, too unstable. But I believed then, as I believe now, that Africa's potential is unlimited if we can get the governance right.

Celtel succeeded because we insisted on doing business the right way. We refused to pay bribes. We demanded transparency in our dealings with governments. We invested in local communities and trained local employees. We showed that it was possible to build a successful business in Africa while maintaining the highest ethical standards.

But individual companies cannot transform a continent. We need systemic change. We need governments that are accountable to their people. We need institutions that are strong and independent. We need leaders who put the public interest above their personal interests.

This is why the Mo Ibrahim Foundation created the Ibrahim Index of African Governance, which measures governance performance across all African countries. We wanted to create a tool that would help citizens hold their governments accountable and help governments identify areas for improvement.

What the Index shows is that governance matters enormously for development outcomes. Countries with better governance have higher economic growth, better health and education outcomes, and more peaceful societies. Countries with poor governance struggle with poverty, conflict, and instability.

But the Index also shows that progress is possible. We have seen countries like Rwanda, Ghana, and Botswana make significant improvements in governance over time. We have seen leaders like Ellen Johnson Sirleaf in Liberia and Joaquim Chissano in Mozambique demonstrate that it is possible to govern with integrity and leave office voluntarily.

This is why we created the Ibrahim Prize for Achievement in African Leadership – to recognize and celebrate African leaders who have governed well and transferred power peacefully. We want to change the narrative about African leadership and show that good governance is not only possible but is happening across the continent.

But governance is not just about presidents and prime ministers. It is about all of us. It is about the choices we make as citizens, as professionals, as leaders in our communities.

As you leave this university and take your place in the world, you will face many choices about how to conduct yourselves. You will be tempted to take shortcuts, to compromise your principles, to go along with corrupt practices because "that's how things are done."

I urge you to resist these temptations. Be the change you want to see in your countries and your continent. Demand transparency in your workplaces. Refuse to participate in corrupt practices. Hold your leaders accountable. Use your voices to speak up for justice and good governance.

You have been educated at one of the finest universities in the region. You have been given tools and opportunities that many of your peers do not have. With these privileges come responsibilities.

If you are going into business, build companies that operate with integrity and contribute to development. Create jobs for your fellow citizens. Pay your taxes. Treat your employees fairly. Invest in your communities.

If you are going into government, serve the public interest, not your personal interests. Be transparent in your dealings. Listen to your constituents. Make decisions based on evidence and merit, not on personal relationships or political calculations.

If you are going into civil society, hold power accountable. Advocate for the rights of the marginalized. Promote transparency and good governance. Build bridges between different groups and communities.

Whatever field you enter, remember that leadership is not about titles or positions – it is about influence and impact. You can be a leader in your family, your community, your workplace, your country. You can make a difference wherever you are.

But leadership also requires courage. It requires the courage to speak truth to power, to stand up for what is right even when it is difficult, to challenge the status quo when it is unjust.

I have seen too many talented young Africans leave the continent because they are frustrated with poor governance and lack of opportunities. This brain drain is one of Africa's greatest challenges. We are losing our best and brightest at the very time when we need them most.

I understand the frustration. I understand the temptation to seek opportunities elsewhere. But I also believe that Africa needs you. We need your energy, your ideas, your commitment to change.

You don't have to stay in Africa to contribute to Africa's development. The African diaspora plays a crucial role in sending remittances, transferring knowledge, and building networks. But we also need young Africans who are willing to stay and fight for change from within.

The choice is yours, but whatever you choose, don't give up on Africa. Don't accept that poor governance is inevitable. Don't believe that corruption is part of our culture. Don't think that change is impossible.

Change is not only possible – it is happening. Across Africa, we are seeing young people demanding better governance. We are seeing civil society organizations holding governments accountable. We are seeing businesses refusing to participate in corrupt practices. We are seeing leaders emerging who are committed to serving their people.

You are part of this generation of change. You have the education, the tools, and the opportunities to make a difference. The question is: will you use them?

Africa's future depends on governance. And governance depends on leadership. And leadership depends on people like you who are willing to stand up, speak out, and work for change.

The continent that your children and grandchildren inherit will be shaped by the choices you make today. Will it be an Africa of good governance and accountable leadership? Will it be an Africa where institutions are strong and the rule of law prevails? Will it be an Africa where young people have opportunities to succeed and contribute?

I believe the answer is yes, but only if you make it so.

Go out there and be the leaders Africa needs. Build the institutions that will serve future generations. Demand the governance that will unlock Africa's potential.

Africa is counting on you. Don't let us down.

Congratulations, Class of 2018. Make us proud.

It is a great honor to address you today at the University of Ghana, one of Africa's premier institutions of higher learning. As President of the African Development Bank, I have had the privilege of working across our continent to promote development and transformation. Today, I want to talk to you about something that is fundamental to Africa's future: feeding Africa and the world.

Africa must feed itself and help feed the world. We have the land, the water, and the people. What we need is the technology, the investment, and the political will to transform our agriculture.

This is not just about agriculture – it is about Africa's economic transformation, about creating jobs for our young people, about ensuring food security for our growing population, about positioning Africa as a global food powerhouse.

Let me share some facts that might surprise you. Africa has 60% of the world's uncultivated arable land. We have abundant water resources. We have a young, energetic population. Yet we spend $75 billion every year importing food that we could produce ourselves.

This is not just an economic inefficiency – it is a strategic vulnerability. The COVID-19 pandemic showed us what happens when global supply chains are disrupted. Countries that depend on food imports found themselves at risk. Countries that are food self-sufficient were more resilient.

But I see this challenge as an opportunity – perhaps the greatest opportunity of our time. If we can transform African agriculture, we can create millions of jobs, lift millions out of poverty, and position Africa as a major player in global food markets.

When I was Nigeria's Minister of Agriculture, we launched a transformation agenda that changed the face of Nigerian agriculture. We treated agriculture as a business, not a development program. We used technology to reach farmers directly. We created value chains that connected farmers to markets. We attracted private sector investment.

The results were dramatic. Agricultural GDP grew by 6.7% annually. We created 3.5 million jobs. We reduced food imports and increased exports. We showed that African agriculture could be transformed if we had the right policies, the right investments, and the right leadership.

But Nigeria is just one country. Imagine what we could achieve if we scaled this transformation across the entire continent. Imagine an Africa where every country is food secure, where agriculture is a modern, profitable business, where young people see farming as an attractive career option.

This is the vision that drives my work at the African Development Bank. Through our "Feed Africa" strategy, we are investing $24 billion over ten years to transform African agriculture. We are supporting countries to develop agricultural value chains, improve rural infrastructure, and build agricultural institutions.

But transformation requires more than money – it requires a fundamental change in how we think about agriculture.

First, we must embrace technology. African farmers are among the most innovative in the world, but they often lack access to modern technologies that could dramatically increase their productivity. We need to ensure that farmers have access to improved seeds, fertilizers, irrigation systems, and digital tools.

The African Development Bank is supporting the development of agricultural technology hubs across the continent. We are investing in research and development. We are promoting the use of drones, satellites, and artificial intelligence in agriculture.

In Rwanda, farmers are using drones to monitor their crops and optimize fertilizer application. In Kenya, farmers are using mobile phones to access weather information, market prices, and agricultural advice. In Ghana, farmers are using solar-powered irrigation systems to grow crops year-round.

These are not futuristic technologies – they are available today. What we need is the infrastructure, the training, and the financing to make them accessible to all farmers.

Second, we must invest in value addition. For too long, Africa has been content to export raw agricultural products and import processed foods. We export cocoa beans and import chocolate. We export coffee beans and import instant coffee. We export cotton and import textiles.

This must change. We need to process our agricultural products locally, create value-added products, and capture more of the value chain. This will create jobs, increase incomes, and reduce our dependence on imports.

The African Development Bank is supporting the development of agricultural processing zones across the continent. These zones will house food processing companies, provide infrastructure and services, and create thousands of jobs for young people.

Third, we must make agriculture attractive to young people. The average age of farmers in Africa is over 60 years. Our young people are leaving rural areas for cities, seeking opportunities in other sectors. If we don't reverse this trend, we will face a serious agricultural labor shortage in the coming decades.

But young people will only be attracted to agriculture if it is profitable, modern, and respected. We need to show them that agriculture is not about subsistence farming with hand tools – it is about agribusiness, technology, and innovation.

We need to support young agricultural entrepreneurs who are using technology to solve agricultural problems. We need to provide them with access to land, credit, and markets. We need to create agricultural incubation centers and training programs.

Fourth, we must improve rural infrastructure. You cannot have modern agriculture without good roads, reliable electricity, and efficient logistics systems. Farmers need to be able to get their products to market quickly and efficiently. They need access to storage facilities, processing plants, and export terminals.

The African Development Bank is investing heavily in rural infrastructure. We are building roads that connect farming communities to markets. We are supporting the development of irrigation systems that allow year-round farming. We are financing storage facilities that reduce post-harvest losses.

Fifth, we must strengthen agricultural institutions. We need strong research institutions that develop new technologies and practices. We need extension services that transfer knowledge to farmers. We need financial institutions that provide credit to agricultural businesses.

We also need regional institutions that promote agricultural trade and cooperation. The African Continental Free Trade Area creates enormous opportunities for agricultural trade within Africa. We need to ensure that farmers and agribusinesses can take advantage of these opportunities.

Finally, we must ensure that agricultural transformation is inclusive. We cannot leave anyone behind – not smallholder farmers, not women, not young people, not marginalized communities.

Women produce 70% of Africa's food, but they have less access to land, credit, and technology than men. We must ensure that women farmers have equal opportunities to participate in and benefit from agricultural transformation.

Smallholder farmers produce most of Africa's food, but they often lack access to markets and modern technologies. We must ensure that they are integrated into value chains and benefit from agricultural modernization.

As you leave this university and enter your careers, I want to challenge you to think about how you can contribute to Africa's agricultural transformation. You don't all need to become farmers, but you can all play a role.

If you are studying engineering, think about how you can develop technologies that solve agricultural problems. If you are studying business, think about how you can build companies that serve agricultural markets. If you are studying economics, think about how you can design policies that promote agricultural development.

If you are studying computer science, think about how you can use digital technologies to connect farmers to markets, provide agricultural information, and improve supply chains. If you are studying environmental science, think about how you can promote sustainable agricultural practices that protect our natural resources.

Whatever your field of study, remember that agriculture touches every aspect of our economy and society. Food security is national security. Agricultural development is economic development. Rural prosperity is national prosperity.

Africa's agricultural transformation is not just an economic opportunity – it is a moral imperative. We cannot accept that people go hungry on a continent that has the potential to feed the world. We cannot accept that young people leave rural areas because there are no opportunities. We cannot accept that we import food that we could produce ourselves.

The transformation of African agriculture will not happen overnight, and it will not happen without challenges. But it is possible, and it is necessary. Countries like Brazil, India, and China have shown that agricultural transformation can drive economic development and poverty reduction.

Africa can do the same, but only if we have the vision, the commitment, and the leadership to make it happen.

You are the generation that will lead this transformation. You have the education, the energy, and the passion to change Africa's agricultural future. The question is: will you take up this challenge?

Africa is counting on you. Our farmers are counting on you. Future generations are counting on you.

Go out there and help feed Africa and the world.

Congratulations, Class of 2020. Make Africa proud.

It is a profound honor to address you today at the University of the Witwatersrand, an institution that has played such an important role in South Africa's struggle for freedom and democracy. As someone who has dedicated my life to fighting for justice, equality, and human rights, I am deeply moved to speak to a new generation of leaders.

Today, I want to talk to you about something that is fundamental to Africa's future: empowering women and children. The future of Africa depends on how we treat our women and children today. We must invest in their education, protect their rights, and create opportunities for them to thrive.

Throughout my life, I have seen the transformative power of education, the devastating impact of conflict on children, and the incredible strength and resilience of African women. I have learned that no society can truly prosper if it leaves half of its population behind, and no continent can reach its potential if it fails to protect and nurture its children.

When I was growing up in Mozambique under Portuguese colonial rule, education was a privilege reserved for the few. As a young woman, I was told that my role was to be a wife and mother, not a leader or professional. But I was fortunate to have parents who believed in education and who sacrificed to give me opportunities.

That education changed my life. It opened doors that would have remained closed. It gave me the tools to fight for independence, to serve my country as a minister, and to advocate for women and children around the world.

But I was one of the lucky ones. Millions of African girls still do not have access to quality education. They are married off as children, denied opportunities to learn and grow, and trapped in cycles of poverty and dependence.

This is not just a tragedy for these individual girls – it is a tragedy for our entire continent. When we deny education to girls, we waste human potential. When we limit women's participation in the economy, we reduce economic growth. When we exclude women from leadership, we make poorer decisions.

Study after study shows that educating girls is one of the most effective ways to promote development. Educated women have fewer children, and those children are healthier and better educated. Educated women earn more money and invest more in their families and communities. Educated women are more likely to participate in politics and advocate for change.

Yet across Africa, millions of girls are still out of school. They face barriers ranging from poverty and cultural attitudes to lack of schools and qualified teachers. They are forced to walk long distances to school, often facing harassment and violence along the way. They lack basic facilities like toilets and clean water that would make school attendance possible.

We must do better. We must ensure that every African girl has access to quality education from primary school through university. We must remove the barriers that keep girls out of school. We must change attitudes that undervalue girls' education. We must invest in schools, teachers, and infrastructure.

But education is not enough. We must also protect women and children from violence, exploitation, and abuse. As someone who has worked extensively on issues of children in armed conflict, I have seen firsthand the devastating impact of war on young lives.

Children are not just victims of conflict – they are often forced to become perpetrators. They are recruited as soldiers, used as human shields, and subjected to unspeakable violence. Girls face the additional burden of sexual violence and forced marriage.

Even in peacetime, too many African children face violence in their homes, schools, and communities. They are subjected to harmful traditional practices, child labor, and sexual abuse. They grow up in poverty, without access to basic services like healthcare and education.

This must stop. We must create a continent where every child is safe, protected, and able to reach their full potential. We must strengthen child protection systems, enforce laws against violence, and change attitudes that normalize abuse.

We must also address the root causes of violence against women and children – poverty, inequality, and harmful gender norms. We must create economic opportunities for women, ensure their equal participation in decision-making, and challenge attitudes that treat women and children as property rather than human beings with rights.

As I have traveled across Africa and around the world, I have been inspired by the incredible strength and resilience of African women. Despite facing enormous challenges, they continue to care for their families, build their communities, and fight for change.

I have met women who have started businesses with nothing but determination and creativity. I have met women who have become leaders in their communities, advocating for better schools, healthcare, and services. I have met women who have survived conflict and violence and have dedicated their lives to helping others heal.

These women are the backbone of our societies. They are the ones who keep families together, who care for the sick and elderly, who ensure that children are fed and educated. They are the ones who build peace in their communities and who fight for justice and equality.

But they should not have to do this alone. We must create systems and institutions that support women's leadership and participation. We must ensure that women have equal access to education, employment, and political participation. We must change laws and policies that discriminate against women.

We must also recognize that empowering women is not just a women's issue – it is a human rights issue that benefits everyone. When women are empowered, families are stronger, communities are more prosperous, and societies are more just and peaceful.

As you leave this university and take your place in the world, I want to challenge you to be champions for women and children. Whether you are men or women, whether you work in business, government, civil society, or academia, you have a role to play in creating a more just and equal world.

If you are going into business, create companies that provide equal opportunities for women and that have family-friendly policies. Invest in businesses led by women and that serve women's needs. Use your economic power to promote gender equality.

If you are going into government, advocate for laws and policies that protect women and children. Ensure that budgets allocate adequate resources for education, healthcare, and social services. Work to eliminate discrimination and violence.

If you are going into civil society, advocate for the rights of women and children. Hold governments and businesses accountable for their commitments to gender equality. Support grassroots organizations led by women.

Whatever field you enter, use your voice to speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves. Challenge discrimination when you see it. Support women's leadership and participation. Mentor young women and girls.

Remember that change is possible. When I was young, few people believed that Mozambique could achieve independence or that apartheid could be defeated in South Africa. But through the courage and determination of ordinary people, these seemingly impossible changes became reality.

The same is true for gender equality and children's rights. Change is possible, but it requires all of us to work together. It requires men and women, young and old, to stand up for what is right.

I have been privileged to work with many remarkable leaders throughout my life, including my late husband Nelson Mandela. From him, I learned that leadership is not about power or position – it is about service and sacrifice. It is about putting the needs of others before your own and working tirelessly for justice and equality.

I also learned that leadership requires both courage and compassion. You must have the courage to speak truth to power, to challenge injustice, and to stand up for what is right even when it is difficult. But you must also have the compassion to understand the suffering of others and to work to alleviate it.

As you begin your careers and your lives as leaders, remember that you have been given tremendous privileges and opportunities. You have received a world-class education. You have access to networks and resources that many people can only dream of.

With these privileges come responsibilities. You have a responsibility to use your talents and opportunities not just for your own benefit, but for the benefit of others. You have a responsibility to lift up those who have been left behind. You have a responsibility to create a more just and equal world.

The women and children of Africa are counting on you. They are counting on you to be their voices when they cannot speak. They are counting on you to fight for their rights when they cannot fight for themselves. They are counting on you to create opportunities when none exist.

Do not let them down. Do not be content with a world where women and children face discrimination, violence, and exclusion. Do not accept that poverty and inequality are inevitable.

You have the power to change the world. You have the education, the energy, and the passion to make a difference. The question is: will you use that power for good?

I believe you will. I believe that your generation will be the one that finally achieves gender equality, that protects all children, and that creates a world where everyone can thrive.

Go out there and make it happen. Africa is counting on you.

Congratulations, Class of 2019. Make us proud.

Thank you.`

    fullText: `Vice-Chancellor de la Rey, distinguished faculty, proud families, and the graduating class of 2021 – congratulations on this remarkable achievement.

It is an honor to address you today at the University of Pretoria, my alma mater and one of South Africa's leading institutions of higher learning. As someone who has spent decades in the mining industry and who is passionate about Africa's development, I want to talk to you about something that is crucial to our continent's future: ensuring that Africa's mineral wealth benefits all Africans.

Africa's mineral wealth must benefit all Africans, not just a few. We must ensure that mining contributes to sustainable development, creates jobs, and protects our environment for future generations.

Africa is blessed with extraordinary mineral wealth. We have some of the world's largest reserves of gold, platinum, diamonds, copper, cobalt, and many other minerals that are essential for modern life. These resources have the potential to transform our continent, to lift millions out of poverty, and to position Africa as a major player in the global economy.

But for too long, Africa's mineral wealth has been extracted by others for the benefit of others. Colonial powers took our resources to build their economies while leaving us with little to show for it. Even after independence, too many mining operations have continued to extract wealth from Africa without contributing adequately to local development.

This must change. We must ensure that Africa's mineral resources become a blessing, not a curse. We must ensure that mining contributes to sustainable development, creates decent jobs, and builds the infrastructure and institutions that our countries need to prosper.

When I started African Rainbow Minerals over two decades ago, I was determined to show that African mining companies could operate differently. We committed to empowering local communities, creating opportunities for previously disadvantaged South Africans, and operating with the highest environmental and safety standards.

We invested in education and training programs to develop local skills. We supported small businesses and entrepreneurs in mining communities. We contributed to healthcare, education, and infrastructure development. We showed that mining could be a force for transformation and empowerment.

But one company, or even one country, cannot transform an entire continent. We need systemic change across the African mining industry. We need governments that negotiate fair deals with mining companies. We need companies that are committed to sustainable development. We need communities that are empowered to participate in and benefit from mining activities.

First, we must ensure that African countries get fair value for their mineral resources. For too long, we have been content to export raw materials at low prices and import finished products at high prices. We export copper ore and import copper wire. We export iron ore and import steel. We export diamonds and import jewelry.

This must change. We need to add value to our mineral resources locally. We need to develop processing industries that create jobs and capture more of the value chain. We need to build the infrastructure and develop the skills that will enable us to compete in global markets.

The African Continental Free Trade Area creates enormous opportunities for intra-African trade in minerals and processed products. We need to take advantage of these opportunities to build integrated value chains across the continent.

Second, we must ensure that mining creates decent jobs for African workers. Mining has the potential to create millions of jobs, from extraction and processing to transportation and services. But these must be good jobs that pay fair wages, provide safe working conditions, and offer opportunities for advancement.

We need to invest in education and training programs that prepare African workers for careers in mining. We need to ensure that women have equal opportunities to participate in the mining industry. We need to support the development of local suppliers and service providers.

We also need to ensure that mining communities benefit from mining activities. Too often, mining takes place in remote areas where local communities see little benefit from the wealth being extracted from their land. This creates resentment and conflict that benefits no one.

Mining companies must work with local communities to ensure that they share in the benefits of mining. This means investing in local infrastructure, supporting local businesses, and creating opportunities for local employment. It means respecting local cultures and traditions and ensuring that communities have a voice in decisions that affect them.

Third, we must ensure that mining is environmentally sustainable. Mining has historically had a significant environmental impact, from air and water pollution to habitat destruction and climate change. As we face the growing threat of climate change, we cannot continue with business as usual.

The mining industry must embrace clean technologies and sustainable practices. We must minimize our environmental footprint and work to restore damaged ecosystems. We must ensure that future generations inherit a healthy planet, not a degraded one.

This is not just about corporate responsibility – it is about business sustainability. Companies that fail to address environmental concerns will face increasing regulatory pressure, investor scrutiny, and community opposition. Companies that embrace sustainability will be better positioned for long-term success.

Fourth, we must ensure good governance in the mining sector. Too often, mineral wealth has been associated with corruption, conflict, and poor governance. We have seen countries where vast mineral wealth has enriched a few while leaving the majority in poverty.

We need transparent and accountable governance systems that ensure mineral revenues are used for public benefit. We need strong institutions that can negotiate fair contracts, monitor compliance, and ensure that revenues are invested in development priorities.

We need civil society organizations that can hold governments and companies accountable. We need media that can investigate and report on mining activities. We need citizens who are informed about their rights and empowered to demand accountability.

Fifth, we must leverage technology and innovation to transform African mining. The mining industry is undergoing a technological revolution, with advances in automation, artificial intelligence, and data analytics transforming how mining is done.

African mining companies must embrace these technologies to improve productivity, reduce costs, and minimize environmental impact. We must invest in research and development to develop solutions that are appropriate for African conditions.

We must also ensure that technological advancement creates opportunities for African workers, not just displaces them. This means investing in education and training programs that prepare workers for the jobs of the future.

As you leave this university and enter your careers, I want to challenge you to think about how you can contribute to transforming Africa's mining industry. You don't all need to work in mining, but you can all play a role in ensuring that Africa's mineral wealth benefits all Africans.

If you are studying engineering, think about how you can develop technologies that make mining safer, cleaner, and more efficient. If you are studying business, think about how you can build companies that add value to Africa's mineral resources.

If you are studying law, think about how you can help negotiate fair contracts and develop regulatory frameworks that protect public interests. If you are studying environmental science, think about how you can help minimize mining's environmental impact.

If you are studying economics, think about how mineral revenues can be used to promote sustainable development. If you are studying social sciences, think about how mining can contribute to social transformation and empowerment.

Whatever your field of study, remember that Africa's mineral wealth belongs to all Africans. It is not the private property of mining companies or political elites. It is a common heritage that must be managed for the benefit of current and future generations.

The transformation of Africa's mining industry will not be easy. It will require changes in policies, practices, and attitudes. It will require collaboration between governments, companies, communities, and civil society. It will require leadership from people like you who are committed to building a better Africa.

But the potential rewards are enormous. If we can get mining right, we can create millions of jobs, generate billions in revenues, and build the infrastructure and institutions that Africa needs to prosper. We can position Africa as a major player in the global economy and ensure that our children inherit a continent of opportunity and prosperity.

You are the generation that will lead this transformation. You have the education, the energy, and the passion to change how mining is done in Africa. The question is: will you take up this challenge?

Africa's mineral wealth is waiting to be unlocked for the benefit of all Africans. The tools and knowledge you need are available. The opportunities are there.

Go out there and make it happen. Transform Africa's mining industry. Ensure that our mineral wealth becomes a blessing for all.

Congratulations, Class of 2021. Make Africa proud.

Thank you.`

    fullText: `Dean Williams, distinguished faculty, proud families, and most importantly, graduates of Harvard University,

It is an extraordinary honor to stand before you today as the first elected female head of state in Africa. But I stand here not just as a president, but as a woman who has broken barriers, faced challenges, and refused to accept limitations.

The size of your dreams must always exceed your current capacity to achieve them. If your dreams do not scare you, they are not big enough.

When I first entered politics in Liberia, people told me that politics was not for women. When I ran for president, they said a woman could never lead an African nation. When I won, they said I would fail because I was too old, too educated, too foreign.

But I had learned something important: that leadership is not about being perfect, it's about being persistent. It's not about having all the answers, it's about asking the right questions. It's not about avoiding failure, it's about learning from it and moving forward.

Throughout my career, I have seen the devastating effects of war, poverty, and inequality. I have seen children forced to become soldiers, women denied basic rights, and entire communities destroyed by conflict. But I have also seen the incredible resilience of the human spirit, the power of hope, and the transformative potential of good leadership.

When I became president of Liberia in 2006, our country was emerging from 14 years of civil war. Our infrastructure was destroyed, our institutions were weak, and our people had lost faith in government. Many said the task was impossible.

But we believed in the power of education, the importance of women's participation, and the necessity of good governance. We worked to rebuild our schools, to empower our women, and to create transparent and accountable institutions.

Today, Liberia is at peace. Our children are in school instead of carrying guns. Our women are participating in all levels of society. Our economy is growing, and our democracy is strong.

This transformation did not happen overnight, and it did not happen without setbacks. There were times when I doubted myself, times when the challenges seemed insurmountable, times when I wanted to give up.

But I remembered the words of my grandmother, who told me that a woman's place is wherever she chooses to be, and that education is the one thing that no one can take away from you.

Education is indeed the foundation of democracy, the pathway to prosperity, and the key to human dignity. It is what has brought you here today, and it is what will enable you to change the world tomorrow.

As you leave this great institution, remember that you have a responsibility to use your education not just for personal advancement, but for the advancement of humanity. You have a responsibility to speak for those who have no voice, to stand up for those who cannot stand up for themselves, to lead where others fear to go.

Women, in particular, must claim their rightful place in leadership. For too long, we have been told that we are not strong enough, not smart enough, not experienced enough to lead. But we know better. We know that diversity in leadership leads to better decisions, that women's participation strengthens democracy, and that gender equality benefits everyone.

Do not let anyone tell you that your dreams are too big, your goals too ambitious, or your vision too bold. The world needs your energy, your ideas, and your leadership.

As you go forth from this place, remember that leadership is not a privilege, it's a responsibility. It's not about power, it's about service. It's not about what you can get, it's about what you can give.

The challenges facing our world today - poverty, inequality, climate change, conflict - require bold leadership and innovative solutions. They require leaders who are willing to take risks, to challenge the status quo, and to work across boundaries and differences.

You are that generation of leaders. You have the education, the tools, and the opportunity to make a real difference in the world.

So dream big, work hard, and never give up. The future is counting on you.

Congratulations, Class of 2011. Go forth and lead.

Thank you.`

    fullText: `Vice-Chancellor, distinguished faculty, proud families, and graduates of the University of Cape Town,

Thank you for having me back at my alma mater. Well, sort of. I actually never graduated from here, so this is a bit awkward. But hey, at least I'm finally on campus without security chasing me away!

I want to talk to you today about something that has shaped my life and career: the power of finding humor in the struggle.

Comedy is a way of processing pain. It's a way of taking something that hurts and finding a way to laugh about it, which ultimately helps you heal from it.

Growing up in apartheid South Africa, I learned this lesson early. My very existence was illegal - I was born to a black mother and a white father at a time when such relationships were forbidden. I was literally a crime walking around.

But instead of letting this define me negatively, I learned to find the absurdity in it. I learned to laugh at the ridiculousness of a system that said I shouldn't exist. And that laughter became my superpower.

Your background doesn't define your future. I grew up in Soweto, in poverty, in a broken system. Many people would have said I had no chance of success. But I refused to accept that narrative.

I want you to understand something important: your struggles are not your limitations - they are your qualifications. The challenges you've faced, the obstacles you've overcome, the pain you've endured - these are not weaknesses. They are your unique strengths.

When I started doing comedy in South Africa, people told me I would never make it internationally because my humor was "too African," "too specific," "too different." But I realized that my difference was exactly what the world needed to hear.

Embrace your uniqueness as your strength. Don't try to fit into someone else's mold. The world doesn't need another copy of someone else - it needs the original you.

When I got to America and started working on The Daily Show, I could have tried to sound like an American, to hide my accent, to pretend I was something I wasn't. But I realized that my perspective as an African, as an outsider looking in, was exactly what made my voice valuable.

Use your voice to tell important stories. Comedy gave me a platform, but I used that platform to talk about serious issues - racism, inequality, injustice. I learned that you can make people laugh and make them think at the same time.

You don't have to choose between being successful and being authentic. You don't have to choose between making money and making a difference. You can do both.

I want to share something with you that my mother taught me. She said, "Trevor, you can be anything you want to be, but you must never forget where you come from." She taught me that success is not about escaping your past - it's about honoring it while building your future.

My mother also taught me the power of language. She made sure I could speak multiple languages because she knew that language is power. When you can speak to people in their own language, you can connect with them in ways that transcend barriers.

Here in South Africa, we have 11 official languages. That's not a burden - that's a superpower. You can connect with more people, understand more perspectives, and bridge more divides than almost anyone else in the world.

But language is not just about words - it's about understanding. It's about empathy. It's about being able to see the world through someone else's eyes.

As you leave this university, you're going to face a world that is often divided, often angry, often afraid. You're going to encounter people who look different from you, think different from you, believe different things than you do.

Your job is not to judge them or change them - your job is to understand them. Your job is to find the common humanity that connects us all.

I've learned that laughter is a universal language. No matter where I go in the world, no matter what language people speak, laughter sounds the same. It breaks down barriers, builds bridges, and reminds us that we're all human.

So as you go out into the world, remember to laugh. Laugh at yourself, laugh with others, and help others find reasons to laugh. The world is serious enough - it needs more joy, more lightness, more hope.

But also remember that with your education comes responsibility. You have been given tools that many people in our country and our continent still don't have access to. Use those tools not just for your own advancement, but to lift others up.

South Africa needs you. Africa needs you. The world needs your voices, your perspectives, your solutions to the challenges we face.

Don't let anyone tell you that you're not good enough, smart enough, or worthy enough. You are graduates of one of the finest universities in Africa. You have already proven that you can achieve great things.

Now go out there and prove that you can achieve even greater things. Make us laugh, make us think, make us better.

And remember - if a mixed-race kid from Soweto can end up hosting an American television show, then anything is possible.

Congratulations, Class of 2018. The world is waiting for your unique brand of magic.

Thank you, and stay funny!`

    fullText: `President Nelson, distinguished faculty, proud families, and graduates of Hampshire College,

Thank you for this incredible honor. Standing here today, I am reminded of my own journey and the power of dreams that seemed impossible not too long ago.

No matter where you're from, your dreams are valid. You have been born into a world that celebrates diversity, and your difference is your strength.

I want to share with you a story about a little girl who grew up in Kenya, who loved movies but never saw anyone who looked like her on the big screen. That little girl was me.

When I was young, I would watch Hollywood movies and dream of being an actress. But I never saw anyone who looked like me in leading roles. I never saw dark-skinned African women being celebrated for their beauty, their talent, their humanity.

For a long time, I thought that meant there was no place for me in that world. I thought that my dreams were too big, too unrealistic, too impossible.

But my parents taught me something important: they taught me that my worth was not determined by how others saw me, but by how I saw myself. They taught me that beauty comes in all shades, all shapes, all sizes.

When I came to America to study at Yale School of Drama, I was one of the few African students in my program. I felt different, sometimes isolated, sometimes like I didn't belong.

But I learned that my difference was not a weakness - it was my strength. My perspective as an African woman, my experiences growing up in Kenya, my understanding of different cultures - these were not obstacles to overcome, but gifts to share.

Representation matters in all fields. When I won the Academy Award for "12 Years a Slave," I received thousands of letters from young girls around the world, especially young black girls, telling me that seeing me on that stage made them believe that their dreams were possible too.

That's when I truly understood the power and responsibility that comes with visibility. When you succeed, you're not just succeeding for yourself - you're opening doors for others who look like you, who come from where you come from, who dream the dreams you once dreamed.

But success is not just about reaching the top - it's about staying true to your authentic self along the way. In an industry that often tries to change you, mold you, make you fit into predetermined boxes, the greatest challenge is remaining yourself.

I have been pressured to lighten my skin, to straighten my hair, to lose weight, to change my accent. I have been told that I am "too dark" for some roles and "not African enough" for others. But I learned that when you compromise your authenticity for acceptance, you lose the very thing that makes you special.

Stay true to your authentic self. The world doesn't need another copy of someone else - it needs the original you.

Your education here at Hampshire has prepared you not just with knowledge, but with the ability to think critically, to question assumptions, to challenge the status quo. Use these skills not just in your careers, but in your lives.

Question the narratives that tell you who you can and cannot be. Challenge the systems that limit opportunities based on race, gender, class, or nationality. Create new stories that include voices that have been marginalized or ignored.

As you leave this institution, you're entering a world that is more connected than ever before. You have the opportunity to build bridges across cultures, to create understanding between different communities, to use your talents to make the world more inclusive and more just.

Whether you become artists, scientists, teachers, entrepreneurs, or leaders in any field, remember that you have the power to change the narrative. You have the power to create a world where every child can see themselves reflected in positions of success and leadership.

I want to leave you with this thought: your journey will not always be easy. You will face rejection, criticism, and moments of doubt. There will be times when you question whether your dreams are worth pursuing.

But remember that every "no" brings you closer to a "yes." Every rejection teaches you something valuable. Every challenge makes you stronger and more resilient.

And remember that you are not alone. You are part of a global community of dreamers, creators, and change-makers. You are connected to everyone who has ever dared to dream big, to challenge conventions, to believe in the impossible.

The little girl from Kenya who dreamed of being in movies never imagined she would one day stand on stages like this, inspiring others to pursue their dreams. But here I am, and here you are, proof that dreams do come true when you combine them with hard work, persistence, and authenticity.

So go out there and dream boldly. Create fearlessly. Love deeply. And never, ever let anyone convince you that your dreams are too big or that you don't belong.

The world is waiting for your unique contribution. The world needs your voice, your perspective, your talents.

Congratulations, Class of 2014. Make your mark on the world, and make it beautiful.

It is an honor to address you today as someone who has spent her career breaking glass ceilings and challenging the status quo in global economic leadership.

Don't let anyone put you in a box. Don't let anyone tell you that because you're a woman, because you're African, because you're different, that you can't achieve your dreams.

When I first entered the field of development economics, I was often the only woman in the room, the only African in the room, sometimes the only person who looked like me in the entire building. People would question whether I belonged there, whether I had the right qualifications, whether I could handle the pressure.

But I learned something important: being different is not a disadvantage - it's a competitive advantage. My perspective as an African woman, my understanding of development challenges from the ground up, my experience of living in both developed and developing countries - these were not weaknesses, they were strengths.

Use your difference as a competitive advantage. The world's biggest challenges - poverty, inequality, climate change, pandemics - cannot be solved by people who all think the same way, who all come from the same backgrounds, who all have the same experiences.

Global challenges require diverse perspectives. They require people who can see problems from different angles, who can propose solutions that others might not think of, who can connect with communities that have been left out of traditional decision-making processes.

When I served as Nigeria's Finance Minister, I was tasked with reforming an economy plagued by corruption, inefficiency, and lack of transparency. Many people said it was impossible, that the system was too entrenched, that change would never come.

But we proved them wrong. We implemented reforms that increased transparency, reduced corruption, and improved economic growth. We showed that with the right policies and the right leadership, even the most challenging problems can be solved.

Economic empowerment is key to development. You cannot have sustainable development without economic growth, and you cannot have inclusive economic growth without empowering all segments of society, especially women and marginalized communities.

When I became the first woman and first African to lead the World Trade Organization, I knew that I was not just representing myself - I was representing all the women and Africans who had been told they couldn't reach such positions.

But representation is not enough. It's not enough to just be in the room - you have to use your voice, you have to make a difference, you have to ensure that your presence leads to better outcomes for the people you represent.

At the WTO, I have worked to ensure that trade policies benefit not just the wealthy and powerful, but also small businesses, women entrepreneurs, and developing countries. I have pushed for reforms that make global trade more inclusive and more sustainable.

Your MIT education has given you tools that are incredibly powerful - analytical thinking, problem-solving skills, technological expertise, and the ability to innovate. But with these tools comes responsibility.

You have a responsibility to use your knowledge not just for personal gain, but for the betterment of humanity. You have a responsibility to ensure that the benefits of technology and innovation are shared broadly, not concentrated in the hands of a few.

As you enter the workforce, you will face choices about what kind of career to pursue, what kind of impact to make, what kind of legacy to leave. I encourage you to think beyond just financial success or personal achievement.

Think about how you can use your skills to solve problems that matter. Think about how you can create opportunities for others who may not have had the same advantages you've had. Think about how you can build a more inclusive and equitable world.

The challenges facing our world today are complex and interconnected. Climate change, inequality, technological disruption, geopolitical tensions - these issues require leaders who can think systemically, who can work across boundaries, who can bring different perspectives together.

You are that generation of leaders. You have been educated at one of the world's finest institutions. You have access to cutting-edge technology and knowledge. You have the opportunity to shape the future in ways that previous generations could only dream of.

But remember that leadership is not just about having the right skills or knowledge - it's about having the courage to use them. It's about being willing to take risks, to challenge conventional wisdom, to stand up for what you believe in.

Don't be afraid to be the first. Don't be afraid to be different. Don't be afraid to fail. Some of the most important breakthroughs in history have come from people who were willing to try something that others thought was impossible.

As you leave MIT and enter the world, remember that you are not just individuals pursuing your own dreams - you are part of a global community working to solve humanity's greatest challenges.

The future is not predetermined. It will be shaped by the choices you make, the risks you take, the problems you choose to solve. Make sure that future is one where everyone has the opportunity to thrive.

Congratulations, Class of 2019. The world needs your brilliance, your innovation, and your leadership.

Go forth and break some glass ceilings of your own.

Thank you.`

Thank you for this incredible honor. Standing here today, I am reminded of a young girl who was shot for going to school, who was told that education was not for her kind, who was silenced for speaking up for what she believed in.

That girl was me. And today, I stand before you as proof that no force is powerful enough to stop the human spirit when it is determined to learn, to grow, and to change the world.

One child, one teacher, one book, and one pen can change the world. Education is the only solution. Education first.

When I was growing up in the Swat Valley of Pakistan, I witnessed firsthand how extremism tries to silence voices, especially the voices of women and girls. The Taliban banned girls from going to school, but my father and I refused to accept this injustice.

I spoke out because I believed that education is a basic human right. I spoke out because I knew that when we educate girls, we educate entire communities. I spoke out because silence in the face of injustice is complicity.

On October 9, 2012, I was shot by the Taliban for advocating for girls' education. They thought that bullet would silence me. Instead, it amplified my voice and the voices of millions of girls around the world who are denied education.

Every girl deserves the right to education. Today, 130 million girls around the world are out of school. They are denied education because of poverty, because of conflict, because of discrimination, because of harmful traditional practices.

But I have seen the power of education to transform lives. I have seen girls who were once told they were worthless become doctors, teachers, engineers, and leaders. I have seen communities that were once divided by ignorance come together through understanding.

Education is not just about learning facts and figures. Education is about learning to think critically, to question assumptions, to challenge injustice. Education is about developing empathy, understanding different perspectives, and building bridges between communities.

Use your voice to speak for those who cannot speak. You have been given an incredible privilege - a Harvard education. With that privilege comes responsibility. You have a responsibility to use your knowledge, your skills, and your voice to make the world a better place.

There are still too many places in the world where girls are married off as children, where women are denied basic rights, where people are persecuted for their beliefs. Your voice can make a difference in changing these realities.

Small actions can create global change. When I started speaking out for girls' education, I was just one girl with one voice. But that one voice joined with others, and together we created a movement that has reached every corner of the globe.

You don't need to be famous or powerful to make a difference. You just need to care enough to act. Whether you become a teacher, a doctor, an engineer, a business leader, or anything else, you can use your position to advocate for those who need advocates.

The world needs your energy, your ideas, and your commitment to justice. The world needs you to continue the fight for equality, for human rights, for peace.

As you leave Harvard and enter the world, remember that education is not a privilege - it is a right. And it is your responsibility to ensure that this right is available to everyone, everywhere.

I want to end with a message to all the young people listening: You are not too young to make a difference. You are not too small to change the world. Your voice matters. Your dreams matter. Your education matters.

Let us pick up our books and our pens. They are our most powerful weapons. One child, one teacher, one book, and one pen can change the world.

Thank you, and congratulations to the Class of 2023.`

    fullText: `President Zimmer, distinguished faculty, proud families, and graduates of the University of Chicago,

Thank you for this honor. It's wonderful to be back at this institution that has shaped so many brilliant minds and continues to push the boundaries of human knowledge.

Today, I want to talk about something that might seem unusual for a technology CEO: empathy. The true scarce commodity of the future will be human attention and empathy. Technology should amplify human capability and human empathy, not replace it.

When I became CEO of Microsoft, I knew that our company needed to fundamentally change. We had become known for a "know-it-all" culture, where being the smartest person in the room was valued above all else. But I realized that in a world of rapid change, what we really needed was a "learn-it-all" culture.

Growth mindset over know-it-all attitude. This shift in mindset has been transformational for our company and for me personally. Instead of trying to prove how much we know, we focus on how much we can learn. Instead of being defensive about our mistakes, we see them as opportunities to grow.

This mindset is especially important in technology. The pace of change is accelerating, and the challenges we face are becoming more complex. Climate change, inequality, healthcare, education - these are not problems that any one person or company can solve alone. They require collaboration, humility, and a willingness to learn from others.

Technology should amplify human capability, not replace it. At Microsoft, we talk about empowering every person and organization on the planet to achieve more. This is not about replacing human intelligence with artificial intelligence. It's about augmenting human intelligence, about giving people tools that help them be more creative, more productive, more connected.

I've learned this lesson personally through my son Zain, who has cerebral palsy. Watching him navigate the world has taught me about the importance of inclusive design. When we design technology with accessibility in mind from the beginning, we don't just help people with disabilities - we create better products for everyone.

Inclusive design benefits everyone. The curb cut was designed for people in wheelchairs, but it helps everyone - parents with strollers, delivery workers with carts, travelers with luggage. Similarly, when we design technology to be accessible, we often discover innovations that benefit all users.

This principle applies beyond technology. In your careers, whatever field you choose, remember that diversity of thought, background, and experience makes teams stronger. Seek out perspectives that are different from your own. Listen to voices that have been marginalized. Include people who might see problems and solutions that you cannot.

Empathy is not just about being nice - it's about being effective. When you truly understand the needs and experiences of your customers, your colleagues, your community, you can create solutions that actually work. You can build products that people love. You can lead teams that are engaged and motivated.

But empathy requires effort. It requires you to step outside your own experience and try to understand someone else's. It requires you to listen more than you speak. It requires you to admit when you don't know something and ask for help.

As you leave this university and enter the world, you will face challenges that seem insurmountable. You will encounter problems that don't have easy solutions. You will work with people who see the world very differently than you do.

In those moments, remember that your greatest strength is not your intelligence or your technical skills - though those are important. Your greatest strength is your ability to connect with other human beings, to understand their needs, to work together toward common goals.

The future belongs to those who can combine technical excellence with human empathy. The future belongs to those who can build bridges across differences. The future belongs to those who can see technology not as an end in itself, but as a means to empower human potential.

You are graduating at a time of incredible opportunity and incredible responsibility. The tools at your disposal are more powerful than any generation before you has ever had. Use them wisely. Use them with empathy. Use them to create a world where everyone can thrive.

Congratulations, Class of 2022. The world needs your brilliance, but even more, it needs your humanity.

Thank you.`

    fullText: `Vice-Chancellor McCutcheon, distinguished faculty, proud families, and graduates of the University of Auckland,

Kia ora and congratulations to the Class of 2021. You are graduating at one of the most challenging times in recent history, and yet you have persevered, adapted, and succeeded. That resilience will serve you well in the years ahead.

Today, I want to talk about a different kind of leadership - leadership with kindness. One of the criticisms I've faced over the years is that I'm not aggressive enough or assertive enough, or maybe somehow, because I'm empathetic, it means I'm weak. But I think we've turned that around.

Kindness and empathy are strengths, not weaknesses. When I became Prime Minister, I was determined to lead differently. I wanted to show that you can be both strong and kind, that you can make tough decisions while still caring deeply about people.

The events of March 15, 2019, when a terrorist attacked our Muslim community in Christchurch, tested this philosophy. In that moment of unimaginable tragedy, our response was not to meet hatred with hatred, but to respond with love, compassion, and unity.

We showed the world that in the face of extremism, we would not be divided. We would not let fear win. Instead, we would come together as one people, united in our diversity and strengthened by our shared humanity.

Crisis reveals true character. The COVID-19 pandemic has been another test of leadership and character. We chose to prioritize the health and wellbeing of our people above all else. We chose to be guided by science and evidence, not politics or ideology.

But most importantly, we chose to communicate with honesty, transparency, and compassion. We acknowledged people's fears and concerns. We explained our decisions clearly. We asked for sacrifice, but we also provided support.

Leadership is about bringing people together, not driving them apart. In a world that often seems increasingly divided, we need leaders who can build bridges, who can find common ground, who can appeal to our better angels.

This doesn't mean avoiding difficult conversations or tough decisions. It means approaching them with empathy and understanding. It means listening to different perspectives. It means being willing to admit when you're wrong and change course when necessary.

Young people can lead change. Throughout history, it has been young people who have driven the most significant social and political changes. From the civil rights movement to the fight against climate change, young voices have been at the forefront of progress.

You don't need to wait until you're older or more experienced to make a difference. You don't need permission to speak up for what you believe in. Your voice matters now, and the world needs to hear it.

As you enter the workforce and take on leadership roles, remember that leadership is not about having all the answers. It's about asking the right questions. It's about creating space for others to contribute. It's about building teams where everyone feels valued and heard.

The challenges facing our world - climate change, inequality, technological disruption, global health crises - require new approaches and fresh thinking. They require leaders who can think beyond traditional boundaries and conventional wisdom.

But they also require leaders who understand that at the heart of every policy, every decision, every initiative, there are real people with real lives. Leaders who remember that behind every statistic is a human story.

New Zealand has always punched above its weight on the global stage, not because of our size or our military might, but because of our values. We believe in fairness, in equality, in looking after each other. We believe that small countries can make a big difference.

As you go out into the world, carry these values with you. Show the world that success doesn't have to come at the expense of others. Show them that you can be competitive while still being collaborative. Show them that you can be ambitious while still being kind.

The future belongs to those who can combine competence with compassion, who can be both effective and empathetic. The future belongs to those who understand that true strength comes not from dominating others, but from lifting them up.

You are graduating into a world that desperately needs this kind of leadership. A world that needs people who can bring out the best in others, who can unite rather than divide, who can lead with both their heads and their hearts.

Congratulations, Class of 2021. Go out there and show the world what leadership with kindness looks like.

Thank you.`

    ],
    fullText: `President Klausner, distinguished faculty, proud families, and graduates of Tel Aviv University,

Congratulations on reaching this milestone. You are graduating into a world that is changing faster than ever before, a world where the only constant is change itself.

In a world deluged by irrelevant information, clarity is power. We live in an age where we have access to more information than any generation in human history, yet we often feel more confused and uncertain than ever. The challenge is not accessing information - it's knowing what information to trust, what questions to ask, and how to think clearly about complex problems.

The most important skill in the 21st century will be the ability to learn, unlearn, and relearn. The knowledge you've acquired here at university is valuable, but it's not enough. The half-life of specific skills and knowledge is shrinking rapidly. What you learned in your first year may already be outdated by the time you graduate.

This doesn't mean your education has been worthless. On the contrary, you've learned something far more valuable than any specific piece of information: you've learned how to learn. You've developed critical thinking skills. You've learned to question assumptions and analyze evidence.

Question everything, especially your own beliefs. One of the most dangerous traps in the modern world is the echo chamber - surrounding ourselves with information and people that confirm what we already believe. Social media algorithms are designed to show us content that we're likely to engage with, which often means content that confirms our existing biases.

As educated individuals, you have a responsibility to actively seek out perspectives that challenge your worldview. Read sources you disagree with. Engage with people who see the world differently. Be willing to change your mind when presented with compelling evidence.

The rise of artificial intelligence and automation will transform the job market in ways we can barely imagine. Many jobs that exist today will disappear, while new jobs that we can't yet envision will emerge. The key to thriving in this environment is not to resist change, but to embrace it.

Technology is a tool, not a master. We often talk about technological progress as if it's an unstoppable force of nature, but technology is created by humans, and it can be shaped by human choices. The question is not whether technology will change our world - it's how we will choose to use technology to shape the kind of world we want to live in.

Artificial intelligence can help us solve complex problems, from climate change to disease. But it can also be used to manipulate public opinion, invade privacy, and increase inequality. The outcome depends on the choices we make as a society.

As you enter the workforce, you'll have the opportunity to influence these choices. Whether you become engineers, doctors, teachers, artists, or entrepreneurs, you'll be part of shaping how technology is developed and deployed.

The challenges facing humanity in the 21st century - climate change, nuclear weapons, technological disruption, global inequality - are global challenges that require global cooperation. No single country, no matter how powerful, can solve these problems alone.

Yet we live in an era of rising nationalism and declining international cooperation. Building the institutions and relationships necessary to address global challenges will require a new generation of leaders who think beyond national boundaries.

You are part of that generation. You've grown up in a connected world. You understand that what happens in one part of the globe affects everyone else. You have the tools and the perspective to build bridges across cultures and nations.

But global thinking must be combined with local action. The most effective way to change the world is often to start in your own community. Identify problems you care about and work to solve them, whether that's improving education in your neighborhood, protecting the local environment, or supporting vulnerable populations.

The future is not predetermined. It will be shaped by the choices you make, individually and collectively. You have more power to influence the course of history than you might realize.

But with that power comes responsibility. The decisions you make in your careers, in your personal lives, and as citizens will help determine what kind of world future generations inherit.

Use your education wisely. Think critically. Question assumptions. Embrace change while holding onto your values. Work to build a world that is more just, more sustainable, and more humane.

The 21st century will be defined by how well humanity learns to cooperate in the face of unprecedented challenges. You have the knowledge, the tools, and the opportunity to help write that story.

Make it a good one.

Congratulations, Class of 2020.`

Thank you for inviting me to speak today. I stand before you not as someone who has all the answers, but as someone who has learned the power of asking the right questions and demanding honest answers.

You are the generation that will either solve the climate crisis or live with the consequences of our failure. The choice is yours, and the time is now.

When I started my school strike for climate in 2018, I was just one person sitting outside the Swedish Parliament with a handmade sign. I was told I was too young, too naive, that I didn't understand how the world works.

But I understood something that many adults seemed to have forgotten: that our house is on fire, and we need to act like it.

Small actions can spark global movements. What started as one person's protest became a global movement of millions of young people demanding action on climate change. This shows the power that each of you has to create change.

You don't need to be famous or powerful to make a difference. You just need to care enough to act, and to refuse to accept the unacceptable.

The science is clear. We are in a climate emergency. The window for limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius is rapidly closing. Every fraction of a degree matters. Every year matters. Every choice matters.

Science must guide our decisions, not politics, not economics, not convenience. The laws of physics don't negotiate. The laws of chemistry don't care about our political systems or our economic models.

Yet for decades, we have been told that we can solve the climate crisis without fundamentally changing our economic system, without challenging the pursuit of endless growth on a finite planet, without questioning the systems that got us into this crisis in the first place.

This is not true. We cannot solve a crisis with the same mindset that created it.

The solutions exist. Renewable energy is now cheaper than fossil fuels in most parts of the world. We have the technology to dramatically reduce emissions. We know what needs to be done.

What we lack is not technology or knowledge - what we lack is political will and the courage to tell the truth about what the science demands.

Hope comes through action, not words. I am often asked if I have hope for the future. My answer is that hope is not something you have - hope is something you create through your actions.

Every solar panel installed, every forest protected, every fossil fuel project stopped, every politician held accountable - these actions create hope.

You have been educated at one of the world's great universities. You have knowledge, skills, and opportunities that most people in the world don't have. With that privilege comes responsibility.

Whatever career you choose, whatever path you take, you have the power to be part of the solution. If you become an engineer, design sustainable technologies. If you become a business leader, build companies that prioritize the planet alongside profit. If you become a teacher, educate the next generation about the climate crisis. If you become a politician, have the courage to tell the truth and make the hard decisions.

The climate crisis is not just an environmental issue - it's a justice issue. The people who have contributed least to the problem are suffering the most from its consequences. Small island nations are disappearing beneath rising seas. Farmers in Africa are facing unprecedented droughts. Indigenous communities are seeing their traditional ways of life destroyed.

Climate action is about justice, about ensuring that everyone has the right to a livable future.

You are graduating into a world that is already experiencing the impacts of climate change. You will see more extreme weather, more displacement, more conflict over resources. But you are also graduating into a world where the solutions are becoming clearer and more achievable every day.

The question is not whether we can solve the climate crisis - the question is whether we will choose to do so.

I believe in your generation because you have grown up understanding that the climate crisis is real. You haven't had the luxury of denial. You know that your future depends on the actions we take today.

But knowledge is not enough. Awareness is not enough. We need action, and we need it now.

Don't let anyone tell you that you're too young to make a difference. Don't let anyone tell you that individual actions don't matter. Don't let anyone tell you that it's too late.

It's not too late, but it's getting close. Every day we delay action makes the challenge harder and the solutions more expensive.

The fossil fuel industry has spent decades spreading misinformation and delaying action. They have known about climate change for decades, yet they chose profits over the planet. Don't let them steal your future.

You have the power to hold them accountable. You have the power to demand better from your leaders. You have the power to create the change we need.

The climate crisis is the defining challenge of our time, but it's also the greatest opportunity. The transition to a sustainable economy will create millions of jobs, improve public health, and build a more just and equitable world.

You can be part of building that world. You can be part of the generation that finally takes the climate crisis seriously and acts with the urgency it demands.

The future is not something that happens to you - it's something you create. So go out there and create a future worth living in.

Thank you, and congratulations to the Class of 2023.`

    fullText: `Director Desai, distinguished faculty, proud families, and graduates of IIT Bombay,

It is an honor to be here at this prestigious institution that has produced some of India's finest minds and leaders. As I look at you today, I see the future of not just India, but the world.

I have always believed that business must have a purpose beyond profit. The true measure of success is not what you accumulate, but what you contribute to society.

When I took over as Chairman of Tata Group, I inherited a legacy built on values - values of integrity, excellence, and service to the nation. These values guided every decision we made, even when it meant sacrificing short-term profits for long-term principles.

Integrity is non-negotiable in leadership. In business, you will face many situations where you could take shortcuts, where you could compromise your values for immediate gain. I urge you to resist these temptations.

Your reputation is built over decades but can be destroyed in moments. Once lost, trust is almost impossible to regain. Build your career on a foundation of honesty, transparency, and ethical behavior.

Innovation should solve real problems. As engineers and technologists, you have the power to create solutions that can transform lives. But innovation for its own sake is meaningless. Focus on innovations that address real human needs.

When we developed the Tata Nano, our goal was not to create the cheapest car in the world for the sake of a record. Our goal was to provide safe, affordable transportation to millions of Indian families who were risking their lives on two-wheelers.

The project faced many challenges, and commercially it didn't achieve all our goals. But it demonstrated something important: that business can be a force for social good, that companies can pursue ambitious goals that benefit society.

Throughout my career, I have seen how business can be a powerful tool for positive change. The Tata Group has always believed in giving back to society. Today, about 66% of the equity capital of Tata Sons is held by philanthropic trusts.

This is not charity - this is responsibility. When society provides you with opportunities, when it enables your success, you have an obligation to give back.

As you begin your careers, remember that success is not just about personal achievement. It's about lifting others up with you. It's about creating opportunities for those who come after you.

India is at a critical juncture in its development. We have the potential to become a global superpower, but we also face enormous challenges - poverty, inequality, environmental degradation, corruption.

You are the generation that will determine which path India takes. You have the education, the skills, and the opportunity to solve these challenges. But you also have the responsibility to ensure that India's growth is inclusive and sustainable.

Don't be afraid to dream big. When we started Tata Consultancy Services in 1968, few people believed that an Indian company could compete globally in technology services. Today, TCS is one of the world's largest IT services companies.

When we launched Tata Tea's Tetley brand globally, people said an Indian company couldn't succeed in international consumer markets. Today, Tetley is one of the world's leading tea brands.

The lesson is simple: don't let others define what's possible for you or for India. Set your own ambitious goals and work relentlessly to achieve them.

But remember that true leadership is not about commanding others - it's about inspiring them. It's about creating an environment where people can do their best work, where they feel valued and motivated.

Listen to your team. Learn from your mistakes. Be willing to admit when you're wrong. The best leaders are those who are constantly learning and growing.

As you go out into the world, you will face setbacks and failures. I have had my share of both. The important thing is not to avoid failure, but to learn from it and bounce back stronger.

When the 26/11 terrorist attacks happened in Mumbai, the Taj Hotel, which is part of the Tata Group, was one of the targets. Our staff showed incredible courage, putting the safety of guests above their own lives.

In that moment of crisis, I saw the true character of our people and our organization. It reinforced my belief that when you build a company based on strong values, those values will guide people to do the right thing even in the most difficult circumstances.

You are graduating at a time of unprecedented opportunity. Technology is democratizing access to information, markets, and resources. A young entrepreneur in a small Indian town can now build a global business from their laptop.

But with this opportunity comes responsibility. Use technology to solve problems, not create them. Build businesses that create value for all stakeholders, not just shareholders.

India needs entrepreneurs who will create jobs, innovators who will solve social problems, leaders who will build institutions that will last for generations.

You have the potential to be those entrepreneurs, innovators, and leaders. But potential is not enough. You need to combine it with hard work, perseverance, and an unwavering commitment to your values.

The future of India is in your hands. Make us proud.

Congratulations, Class of 2019, and best wishes for your journey ahead.`

    fullText: `President Beilock, distinguished faculty, proud families, and graduates of Barnard College,

Thank you for this incredible honor. Standing here today, I'm reminded of my own journey from a small town in India to global stages, and how every step taught me that barriers exist only to be broken.

Don't let anyone put you in a box. You are not too ethnic, too different, too ambitious, or too anything. You are exactly who you're supposed to be.

When I first moved to Hollywood, I was constantly told what I couldn't do. I was too Indian for American roles, too American for Indian roles. My accent was too thick, then too thin. I was too dark, too exotic, too foreign.

But I learned something important: when people try to put you in a box, it's usually because they can't imagine a world where you don't fit into their limited categories. Don't let their lack of imagination become your limitation.

Embrace your differences as your strength. What makes you different is what makes you special. In a world that often tries to make everyone the same, your uniqueness is your superpower.

I grew up in a small town in India where becoming an international actress seemed impossible. But my parents taught me that dreams don't have geographical boundaries. They taught me that if you work hard enough and believe in yourself strongly enough, you can achieve anything.

When I won Miss World at 18, it opened doors I never knew existed. But it also came with responsibilities I wasn't prepared for. Suddenly, I had a platform, and I realized that with that platform came the power to influence and inspire.

Use your platform to amplify other voices. Whatever success you achieve, whatever platform you build, remember that it's not just about you. Use your voice to speak for those who don't have one. Use your success to create opportunities for others.

Throughout my career, I've tried to choose projects that break stereotypes and challenge perceptions. When I played Alex Parrish in "Quantico," I wasn't just playing a character - I was representing the possibility that a South Asian woman could be the lead in an American network television show.

Success is about opening doors for others. Every barrier you break doesn't just benefit you - it makes it easier for the next person who looks like you, who comes from where you come from, who dreams the dreams you dream.

When I started my production company, Purple Pebble Pictures, my goal was to tell stories that hadn't been told, to give opportunities to talent that hadn't been discovered. Because I know what it feels like to be overlooked, to be told you don't fit.

The entertainment industry has the power to shape perceptions and change minds. When people see diverse stories on screen, when they see characters who look like them and share their experiences, it expands their sense of what's possible.

But representation isn't just about entertainment - it's about every industry, every field, every level of leadership. We need diverse voices in boardrooms, in laboratories, in government, in every space where decisions are made.

As women, we face unique challenges. We're often told to be confident but not aggressive, ambitious but not threatening, strong but not intimidating. These contradictions are designed to keep us small, to make us doubt ourselves.

Don't fall for it. Be unapologetically ambitious. Take up space. Speak up in meetings. Negotiate for what you're worth. Support other women. Lift each other up instead of competing with each other.

I've been fortunate to work with UNICEF as a Goodwill Ambassador, and through that work, I've seen the incredible potential that exists in young people around the world. I've also seen the barriers that prevent too many of them from reaching that potential.

Education is the great equalizer, but it's not equally accessible. As educated women, you have a responsibility to ensure that the next generation has even better opportunities than you did.

The world is more connected than ever before, but it's also more divided. We need bridge-builders, people who can connect across cultures, languages, and differences. You have the education, the perspective, and the opportunity to be those bridge-builders.

Don't be afraid to fail. I've had my share of failures - movies that didn't work, projects that didn't get made, opportunities that didn't pan out. But every failure taught me something valuable and made me stronger.

Failure is not the opposite of success - it's part of success. It's how you learn, how you grow, how you develop resilience.

As you leave Barnard and enter the world, remember that you're not just representing yourselves - you're representing all the women who came before you and all the girls who will come after you.

You're graduating from an institution that has always believed in the power of women to change the world. Now it's your turn to prove that belief right.

Dream big. Work hard. Stay true to your values. And never, ever let anyone convince you that you don't belong.

The world needs your voices, your perspectives, your solutions. The world needs you to be exactly who you are.

Congratulations, Class of 2021. Go out there and break some barriers.

Thank you.`

    fullText: `Director Sahoo, distinguished faculty, proud families, and graduates of IIT Kharagpur,

It's wonderful to be back at my alma mater. Standing here today brings back so many memories of my time as a student here, and I'm filled with pride to see how this institution continues to produce world-class engineers and innovators.

Technology should be accessible to everyone, not just the privileged few. Our goal should be to democratize access to information and opportunity.

When I was growing up in Chennai, my family didn't have much money. We didn't have a telephone until I was in college. The idea that I would one day lead a company that connects billions of people around the world seemed impossible.

But I was fortunate to have access to education, and that education opened doors I never knew existed. It taught me that with hard work and determination, you can overcome any obstacle.

Today, we live in an age where a smartphone can give someone in a remote village access to the same information as someone in Silicon Valley. This is the power of technology when it's designed with inclusion in mind.

At Google, we've always believed that information should be universally accessible and useful. But accessibility isn't just about having the technology - it's about making sure that technology works for everyone, regardless of their background, their language, or their economic situation.

Stay curious and keep learning. The field of technology is evolving so rapidly that what you learned in your first year here may already be outdated. But that's not a problem - it's an opportunity.

The most successful people in technology are not those who know the most, but those who are most curious, most willing to learn, most adaptable to change.

When I joined Google in 2004, the company was primarily focused on search. Today, we work on everything from artificial intelligence to quantum computing to autonomous vehicles. The only way to thrive in such an environment is to embrace continuous learning.

Use technology to solve real problems. As engineers, you have the power to create solutions that can improve millions of lives. But with that power comes responsibility.

Don't just build technology for the sake of building it. Ask yourself: Who will this help? How will it make the world better? What problems will it solve?

Some of the most impactful projects at Google have come from engineers who saw a problem in their own communities and decided to solve it. Google Translate started because someone wanted to break down language barriers. Google Maps began because someone wanted to help people navigate the world more easily.

India is uniquely positioned to lead the next wave of technological innovation. We have a young, educated population. We have a thriving startup ecosystem. We have engineers who understand both cutting-edge technology and the needs of emerging markets.

But India's contribution to technology shouldn't just be about serving the Indian market. Indian engineers have the opportunity to build solutions that work for the next billion internet users around the world.

When we launched Google Pay in India, we didn't just create a payment app - we created a platform that could work for people who had never used digital payments before. That innovation is now being applied in other markets around the world.

Artificial intelligence is perhaps the most transformative technology of our time. It has the potential to solve some of humanity's biggest challenges - from climate change to healthcare to education.

But AI also raises important questions about privacy, fairness, and the future of work. As the engineers who will build these systems, you have a responsibility to ensure that AI is developed and deployed responsibly.

We need AI that works for everyone, not just the privileged few. We need AI that respects privacy and human dignity. We need AI that augments human capability rather than replacing it.

The internet has connected billions of people, but we're still in the early stages of realizing its full potential. The next phase of the internet will be about making it more helpful, more personal, and more accessible.

We're working on technologies that will allow people to interact with computers using natural language, that will provide real-time translation between any two languages, that will help people access information even when they don't know exactly what they're looking for.

These technologies will be particularly important for emerging markets, where many people are coming online for the first time and may not be familiar with traditional computing interfaces.

As you begin your careers, remember that success is not just about individual achievement. The most fulfilling careers are those where you can make a positive impact on the world.

Whether you join a large company, start your own business, or pursue research, look for opportunities to use your skills to solve problems that matter.

The challenges facing the world today - climate change, inequality, disease, education - are complex and interconnected. They require innovative solutions and collaborative approaches.

You have the technical skills to contribute to these solutions. But you also need to develop empathy, cultural awareness, and the ability to work with people from different backgrounds and disciplines.

Technology is most powerful when it brings people together, when it helps us understand each other better, when it creates opportunities for collaboration and connection.

As you leave IIT Kharagpur and enter the world, carry with you the values that this institution has instilled in you - excellence, integrity, and service to society.

Use your education not just to build successful careers, but to build a better world. Use your skills not just to create wealth, but to create value for all of humanity.

The future is full of possibilities, and you have the power to shape that future. Make it count.

Congratulations, Class of 2017, and best wishes for your journey ahead.`

    fullText: `President Price, distinguished faculty, proud families, and graduates of Duke University,

Thank you for this incredible honor. Being here with you today, witnessing this celebration of achievement and possibility, fills my heart with joy.

Your truth is the most powerful tool you have. When you honor your truth, you honor yourself and you give others permission to do the same.

I want to share with you something I've learned over the years: that the most important relationship you will ever have is the relationship with yourself. And the foundation of that relationship is truth - knowing who you are, what you value, what you stand for.

For too many years, I tried to be what other people wanted me to be. I tried to fit into boxes that were too small for my spirit. I tried to dim my light so that others wouldn't feel uncomfortable.

But I learned that when you betray yourself, when you live a lie, you rob the world of your unique gifts. You rob yourself of the joy that comes from living authentically.

Honor yourself by living authentically. This doesn't mean being selfish or inconsiderate of others. It means being true to your values, following your passion, speaking your truth with love and respect.

When I started my talk show, television executives told me I was "too emotional," "too personal," "too much." They wanted me to be more like other hosts, to follow a formula that had worked for others.

But I knew that my strength was in my authenticity, in my willingness to be vulnerable, in my ability to connect with people on a human level. So I chose to be myself, fully and completely.

That choice changed everything. It allowed me to build a career that was not just successful, but meaningful. It allowed me to touch lives and make a difference in ways I never could have imagined.

Service to others gives life meaning. Success without service is empty. Achievement without contribution is hollow. The most fulfilling life is one where you use your gifts to lift others up.

I've been blessed with many opportunities in my life, but the moments that have brought me the greatest joy are those when I've been able to help someone else realize their potential, when I've been able to use my platform to shine light on important issues, when I've been able to make a difference in someone's life.

Whether you become a doctor, a teacher, an entrepreneur, an artist, or anything else, look for ways to serve. Look for ways to use your talents to make the world a little bit better.

Every experience teaches you something valuable. I've had my share of failures, disappointments, and setbacks. There were times when I thought my career was over, times when I questioned my worth, times when I felt lost and uncertain.

But I learned that every experience, even the painful ones, has something to teach you. Every setback is a setup for a comeback. Every failure is a lesson in disguise.

The key is to remain open to learning, to see challenges as opportunities for growth, to trust that even when you can't see the path ahead, you're exactly where you need to be.

When I was fired from my first television job in Baltimore, I was devastated. I thought my dreams were over. But that "failure" led me to Chicago, where I found my true calling in daytime television.

When my movie "Beloved" didn't perform well at the box office, I was disappointed. But that experience taught me valuable lessons about storytelling and helped me become a better producer.

Every closed door led to an open window. Every "no" led to a better "yes." Every ending led to a new beginning.

As you leave Duke and enter the world, you will face your own challenges and setbacks. You will encounter people who don't believe in you, opportunities that don't work out, dreams that seem impossible to achieve.

In those moments, remember your truth. Remember your worth. Remember that you have something unique and valuable to offer the world.

Don't let anyone else define your worth or your potential. Don't let fear keep you from pursuing your dreams. Don't let setbacks convince you that you're not capable of greatness.

You are graduating from one of the finest universities in the world. You have been given tools, knowledge, and opportunities that will serve you well. But your greatest asset is not your degree - it's your authentic self.

The world needs what you have to offer. The world needs your perspective, your passion, your unique way of seeing and solving problems.

But the world can only benefit from your gifts if you have the courage to share them, if you have the confidence to be yourself, if you have the commitment to live your truth.

As you go forth from this place, carry with you the knowledge that you are enough, exactly as you are. You don't need to be perfect. You don't need to have all the answers. You just need to be willing to show up, to try, to learn, to grow.

Trust your instincts. Follow your heart. Live your truth. And remember that the greatest gift you can give the world is the gift of your authentic self.

Congratulations, Class of 2018. The world is waiting for what you have to offer.

Thank you.`

    fullText: `President Chameau, distinguished faculty, proud families, and graduates of Caltech,

Thank you for having me here today. It's an honor to address the graduating class of one of the world's premier institutions for science and technology.

I think it's important to reason from first principles rather than by analogy. The normal way we conduct our lives is we reason by analogy.

When I was thinking about starting SpaceX, everyone told me it was impossible. They said, "Look at all the big aerospace companies that have tried and failed. Look at how much money the government spends on space programs. A private company could never compete."

But I didn't accept that reasoning. Instead, I broke the problem down to its fundamental components. What does a rocket actually cost to build? What are the raw materials? What are the manufacturing processes?

When I looked at it from first principles, I realized that the cost of the materials for a rocket is only about 2% of the typical price of a rocket. The rest is inefficiency, bureaucracy, and profit margins built on the assumption that rockets are inherently expensive.

This is the power of first principles thinking. It allows you to see past conventional wisdom and find new solutions to old problems.

Take risks when you're young. Now is the time in your life when you can afford to take big risks. You don't have families depending on you. You don't have mortgages to pay. You have the luxury of being able to fail and recover.

As you get older, your obligations increase. You have more to lose. It becomes harder to take the kinds of risks that can lead to breakthrough innovations.

So if you have an idea that excites you, if you see a problem that needs solving, don't wait. Don't spend years planning and preparing. Start now, while you have the freedom to fail.

Work incredibly hard on things that matter. There's no substitute for hard work. If you're trying to create a company, you need to work super hard. I mean, you need to put in 80 to 100 hour weeks every week.

This improves the odds of success. If other people are putting in 40 hour work weeks and you're putting in 100 hour work weeks, then even if you're doing the same thing, you know that you will achieve in four months what it takes them a year to achieve.

But it's not just about working hard - it's about working hard on things that matter. There are a lot of ways to spend your time that don't create value. Focus on the things that will make the biggest difference.

Don't be afraid to fail. I've failed many times. My first company, Zip2, almost went bankrupt several times. PayPal faced numerous challenges and setbacks. SpaceX had three failed launches before we finally succeeded. Tesla nearly went bankrupt multiple times.

But each failure taught me something valuable. Each setback made me stronger and more determined. Failure is not the opposite of success - it's a stepping stone to success.

The key is to fail fast and learn quickly. Don't spend years working on something that isn't going to work. Test your ideas quickly, get feedback, iterate, and improve.

At SpaceX, our goal is to make life multiplanetary. This might sound like science fiction, but I believe it's essential for the long-term survival of humanity. We need to become a spacefaring civilization.

The technical challenges are enormous, but they're not insurmountable. We've already demonstrated that we can build reusable rockets, which dramatically reduces the cost of space travel. We're working on developing the technology to travel to Mars and establish a sustainable human presence there.

At Tesla, we're working to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy. Climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing humanity, and we need to move away from fossil fuels as quickly as possible.

Electric vehicles are just the beginning. We're also working on energy storage, solar panels, and other technologies that will help create a sustainable energy ecosystem.

The future of transportation is not just electric - it's also autonomous. Self-driving cars will be safer, more efficient, and more convenient than human-driven cars. They'll also enable new business models and ways of thinking about transportation.

At Neuralink, we're working on developing brain-computer interfaces. This technology could help people with paralysis control computers and prosthetic devices with their thoughts. In the long term, it could help humanity keep pace with artificial intelligence.

These might seem like wildly different projects, but they're all connected by a common thread: they're all aimed at solving important problems and making the future better than the present.

As you leave Caltech and enter the world, I encourage you to think big. Don't just aim to make incremental improvements - aim to make breakthrough innovations that can change the world.

The problems facing humanity are complex and challenging, but they're not unsolvable. Climate change, sustainable energy, space exploration, artificial intelligence, biotechnology - these are all areas where breakthrough innovations are needed and possible.

You have the scientific training and technical skills to contribute to these solutions. But you also need the courage to think differently, to challenge conventional wisdom, to take risks.

Don't be satisfied with the status quo. Don't accept that things have to be the way they've always been. Ask yourself: How can we do this better? How can we solve this problem in a completely new way?

The future is not predetermined. It will be shaped by the choices you make and the problems you choose to solve. Make sure you're working on things that matter, things that will make a positive difference in the world.

Congratulations, Class of 2012. The future is in your hands. Make it an amazing one.

Thank you.`

Thank you so much for this honor. It is wonderful to be here at City College, an institution that has been opening doors and changing lives for more than 160 years.

Don't ever make decisions based on fear. Make decisions based on hope and possibility. Make decisions based on what should happen, not what shouldn't.

I want to start by telling you how proud I am of each and every one of you. You have worked hard to get here. You have overcome obstacles, made sacrifices, and persevered through challenges that would have stopped many others.

Your story matters and deserves to be told. Each of you has a unique story - where you come from, what you've overcome, what you've learned along the way. Don't ever let anyone make you feel like your story doesn't matter.

I grew up on the South Side of Chicago in a working-class family. My father was a city water plant employee. My mother was a secretary who later stayed home to raise my brother and me. We didn't have much money, but we had something more valuable - we had parents who believed in the power of education.

Education is the great equalizer. It doesn't matter where you come from, what your parents do for a living, or how much money your family has. If you get a good education, if you work hard and stay focused, you can achieve anything.

That's the promise of America, and that's the promise that institutions like City College have been fulfilling for generations. This college has educated more Nobel Prize winners than any other public institution in America. It has produced leaders in every field imaginable.

But City College's greatest achievement is not the famous people it has produced - it's the ordinary people whose lives have been transformed by education. The first-generation college students who became doctors, teachers, engineers, and entrepreneurs. The immigrants who came here with nothing but dreams and left with the tools to build better lives for their families.

You are part of that legacy now. You are proof that the American Dream is still alive and well.

But with the privilege of education comes responsibility. You have an obligation to use your knowledge and skills not just for your own advancement, but to lift others up as well.

Lift others as you climb. As you achieve success in your careers, remember those who are still struggling. Mentor young people who are where you once were. Support organizations that provide educational opportunities to underserved communities. Use your voice to advocate for policies that expand access to quality education.

The world needs your talents, your perspectives, your solutions to the challenges we face. But the world also needs your compassion, your empathy, your commitment to justice and equality.

We live in a time of great division and uncertainty. There are forces that want to divide us, that want to make us afraid of each other, that want to convince us that our differences make us weak.

But I've learned that our diversity is our strength. When people from different backgrounds, different experiences, different perspectives come together, that's when innovation happens. That's when problems get solved. That's when progress is made.

Don't let anyone tell you that you don't belong, that you're not smart enough, that you're not qualified enough. You have earned your place here. You have proven your worth. You belong at every table where decisions are being made.

But belonging is not enough. You need to speak up. You need to contribute. You need to make your voice heard.

When I was in law school, I was often one of the few African American women in my classes. There were times when I felt like I didn't belong, when I questioned whether I was smart enough to be there.

But I learned that those feelings of doubt and insecurity are normal. Everyone feels them sometimes. The key is not to let them stop you from pursuing your dreams.

I also learned that representation matters. When you see someone who looks like you, who comes from where you come from, achieving success, it expands your sense of what's possible.

That's why it's so important for you to succeed. Not just for yourselves, but for all the young people who will see your success and think, "If they can do it, so can I."

As you leave City College and enter the world, you will face challenges and setbacks. There will be times when you feel discouraged, when you question your abilities, when you wonder if you made the right choices.

In those moments, remember why you started this journey. Remember the dreams that brought you here. Remember the people who believed in you and supported you along the way.

And remember that failure is not the end of your story - it's just a chapter. Every successful person has failed at something. The difference between those who succeed and those who don't is not that successful people never fail - it's that they don't let failure define them.

They learn from their mistakes, they get back up, and they keep moving forward.

You have the education, the skills, and the determination to achieve great things. But more importantly, you have the opportunity to make a difference in the world.

Use that opportunity wisely. Be bold in your dreams, but also be thoughtful in your actions. Take risks, but also take responsibility. Pursue success, but also pursue significance.

The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams. Dream big, work hard, and never give up.

Congratulations, Class of 2016. I can't wait to see what you accomplish.

Thank you.`

Thank you for this incredible honor. Being here with you today, surrounded by so much talent and potential, reminds me why I love what I do.

You are the storytellers of the next generation. You get to write the next chapter of the human story. Make it a good one.

When I was writing Hamilton, people told me I was crazy. "A hip-hop musical about Alexander Hamilton? No one will understand it. No one will come see it. It's too different, too weird, too ambitious."

But I believed in the story I wanted to tell. I believed that the story of America's founding fathers could be told in a new way, with new voices, that would make it relevant and exciting for a new generation.

Embrace your unique perspective and voice. What makes you different is what makes you valuable. Your background, your experiences, your way of seeing the world - these are not obstacles to overcome, they are gifts to share.

I grew up in a Puerto Rican family in New York. I spoke Spanish at home and English at school. I loved both hip-hop and musical theater - two art forms that most people thought had nothing in common.

For a long time, I felt like I didn't fit anywhere. I was too Latino for some spaces, not Latino enough for others. Too hip-hop for musical theater, too musical theater for hip-hop.

But I learned that being in between spaces, being a bridge between different worlds, is actually a superpower. It allows you to see connections that others miss, to bring together ideas that others think don't belong together.

Art has the power to change hearts and minds. When people see themselves reflected in stories, when they see their experiences validated and celebrated, it changes how they see themselves and their place in the world.

When young Latino kids see themselves represented on Broadway, when they see that their stories matter, it expands their sense of what's possible. When people who have never thought about the immigrant experience see it portrayed with humanity and complexity, it changes how they think about immigration.

This is the power of storytelling. It doesn't just entertain - it educates, it inspires, it transforms.

Tell stories that haven't been told before. The world is full of untold stories, unheard voices, unexplored perspectives. Your job as the next generation of leaders, creators, and innovators is to find those stories and bring them to light.

Maybe you'll become a filmmaker who tells stories about communities that have been ignored by Hollywood. Maybe you'll become a journalist who gives voice to the voiceless. Maybe you'll become a teacher who helps young people find their own stories and learn to tell them.

Whatever field you enter, remember that you have the power to shape narratives, to challenge assumptions, to change the conversation.

When I was working on In the Heights, my first musical, I wanted to tell the story of my neighborhood, Washington Heights. I wanted to show the beauty, the complexity, the humanity of a community that was often portrayed in one-dimensional ways in the media.

It took years to get that show produced. People didn't understand why anyone would want to see a musical about Latinos in New York. But I persisted because I knew the story mattered.

When In the Heights finally opened on Broadway, I received letters from young people who said they had never seen themselves represented on stage before. They said it made them proud of who they were and where they came from.

That's when I truly understood the responsibility that comes with having a platform, with having the ability to tell stories that reach large audiences.

The stories we tell shape how we see ourselves and each other. They shape our understanding of what's possible, what's valuable, what's worth fighting for.

As you leave Penn and enter the world, you will have opportunities to tell stories - whether through your work, your art, your activism, or simply through the way you live your life.

Choose to tell stories that bring people together rather than drive them apart. Choose to tell stories that celebrate our common humanity while honoring our differences. Choose to tell stories that inspire hope rather than fear.

The world needs your stories. The world needs your perspective. The world needs your voice.

But having a voice is not enough - you have to use it. You have to be willing to speak up, to take risks, to put yourself out there.

When I first performed at the White House poetry jam in 2009, I was terrified. I was going to perform a song about Alexander Hamilton - a song that would eventually become the opening number of Hamilton - to an audience that included the President and First Lady.

I almost chickened out. I almost performed something safer, something more conventional. But I decided to trust my instincts, to share the story I was passionate about, even if it seemed crazy.

That performance changed my life. It gave me the confidence to pursue Hamilton as a full musical. It showed me that sometimes the craziest ideas are the ones worth pursuing.

Don't be afraid to be different. Don't be afraid to fail. Don't be afraid to dream big.

The world is changing rapidly. The old rules don't always apply. The old gatekeepers don't have the same power they once did. This creates opportunities for new voices, new stories, new ways of doing things.

You are graduating at a time when you have more tools than ever before to tell your stories and share them with the world. Social media, streaming platforms, crowdfunding - these technologies have democratized storytelling in ways that were unimaginable just a few years ago.

Use these tools wisely. Use them to amplify voices that need to be heard. Use them to build communities around shared values and common goals. Use them to create positive change in the world.

Remember that with great power comes great responsibility. The stories you tell, the platforms you build, the communities you create - they all have the potential to influence how people think and act.

Make sure that influence is positive. Make sure you're contributing to a world that is more just, more compassionate, more understanding.

You have been given an incredible education at one of the world's great universities. You have knowledge, skills, and opportunities that most people in the world don't have.

Use them well. Use them to tell stories that matter. Use them to make a difference.

The future is unwritten. You get to help write it. Make it a story worth telling.

Congratulations, Class of 2016. I can't wait to see the stories you tell.

Thank you.`

    fullText: `President Frederick, distinguished faculty, proud families, and graduates of Howard University,

Thank you for this incredible honor. Standing here at the Mecca, at this institution that has produced so many leaders, innovators, and champions, fills me with immense pride.

Being a champion isn't just about winning. It's about how you handle defeat, how you come back from setbacks, how you inspire others to believe in themselves.

I've won 23 Grand Slam singles titles, but I've also lost many matches. I've been defeated, disappointed, and discouraged more times than I can count. But each loss taught me something valuable about myself and about what it takes to succeed.

The difference between champions and everyone else is not that champions never fail - it's that they never give up. They use failure as fuel. They let setbacks motivate them to work harder, to get better, to come back stronger.

Believe in yourself even when others don't. When I was young, people told me I would never make it in tennis. They said I was too aggressive, too emotional, too different. They said tennis wasn't for people who looked like me.

But my parents believed in me, and more importantly, I learned to believe in myself. I knew that I had something special, something that couldn't be measured by conventional standards.

That belief carried me through the toughest moments of my career. When I was struggling with injuries, when I was facing criticism from the media, when I was dealing with personal challenges - my belief in myself never wavered.

You will face people who doubt you, who underestimate you, who try to put you in a box. Don't let them define your limits. Don't let them tell you what you can and cannot achieve.

Use your platform to lift others up. Success is not just about personal achievement - it's about using your success to create opportunities for others.

Throughout my career, I've tried to use my platform to advocate for equality, to support other women, to inspire young people to pursue their dreams. I've spoken out about pay equity, about representation, about the importance of diversity in all fields.

When you achieve success, remember that you didn't get there alone. You had coaches, mentors, family members, and friends who supported you along the way. Your responsibility is to be that support system for someone else.

Excellence requires sacrifice and dedication. There are no shortcuts to greatness. If you want to be the best at what you do, you have to be willing to outwork everyone else.

I've spent countless hours on the practice court, in the gym, working on my technique, my fitness, my mental game. I've missed parties, vacations, and social events because I was committed to my craft.

But those sacrifices were worth it because they allowed me to achieve my dreams and to inspire others to pursue theirs.

Whatever field you enter, whatever goals you set for yourself, remember that excellence is not an accident. It's the result of deliberate practice, consistent effort, and unwavering commitment.

Tennis taught me many lessons that apply far beyond the court. It taught me about resilience, about mental toughness, about the importance of preparation. It taught me that success is not just about talent - it's about character.

When I was pregnant with my daughter and playing in the Australian Open, people questioned whether I should be competing. But I knew my body, I knew my capabilities, and I trusted my instincts. I went on to win that tournament while pregnant.

That experience taught me that women can be strong, competitive, and successful while also being mothers, caregivers, and nurturers. We don't have to choose between our professional ambitions and our personal lives.

As you leave Howard and enter the world, you will face choices about what kind of person you want to be, what kind of impact you want to make, what kind of legacy you want to leave.

Choose to be someone who stands up for what's right, even when it's difficult. Choose to be someone who supports others, even when you're competing against them. Choose to be someone who uses their success to make the world a better place.

The world needs more champions - not just in sports, but in every field. Champions in medicine who work tirelessly to find cures for diseases. Champions in education who ensure that every child has access to quality learning. Champions in business who build companies that serve their communities.

Champions in law who fight for justice and equality. Champions in technology who use innovation to solve real problems. Champions in the arts who tell stories that inspire and unite us.

You have the education, the skills, and the opportunity to be champions in whatever field you choose. But being a champion is not just about what you achieve - it's about how you achieve it.

Compete with integrity. Win with humility. Lose with grace. Treat your opponents with respect. Support your teammates. Give credit where credit is due.

Remember that true champions are not just remembered for their victories - they're remembered for their character, their sportsmanship, their impact on others.

As I near the end of my tennis career, I'm most proud not of the titles I've won, but of the barriers I've broken, the young people I've inspired, the conversations I've started about equality and representation.

That's the legacy I want to leave - not just as a tennis player, but as a person who used her platform to make a difference.

You have the opportunity to create your own legacy. Make it one that you can be proud of. Make it one that inspires others to dream bigger, work harder, and never give up.

The world is waiting for your championship performance. Go out there and show them what you're made of.

Congratulations, Class of 2022. I believe in you, and I can't wait to see the championships you win in life.

Thank you.`

I am very pleased and honored to be here with you today. You know, I've been thinking about what I wanted to say to you, and I keep coming back to something very simple but very profound: You have a story to tell.

Each of you sitting here today has overcome obstacles, faced challenges, and achieved something remarkable. You didn't get here by accident. You got here because somebody believed in you, because somebody sacrificed for you, because somebody dreamed that you could be more than your circumstances.

I want you to remember that as you leave this place and go out into the world. Remember that you carry with you not just your own dreams, but the dreams of all those who made your success possible.

You see, I learned early in life that there is no greater agony than bearing an untold story inside you. Each of us has a story. Each of us has something unique to contribute to this world. But too often, we allow fear to silence us. We allow doubt to diminish us. We allow the voices of others to convince us that our stories don't matter.

But I'm here to tell you today that your story matters. Your voice matters. Your dreams matter.

I grew up in a time and place where people who looked like me were told we couldn't dream big dreams. We were told that certain doors were closed to us, that certain heights were beyond our reach. But I learned that courage is the most important of all the virtues, because without courage, you can't practice any other virtue consistently.

It takes courage to tell your story. It takes courage to stand up for what you believe in. It takes courage to love in a world that seems designed to break your heart. But that courage is what will set you apart.

You have been educated at one of the finest institutions in this country. You have been given tools and knowledge that many people around the world can only dream of having. With that privilege comes responsibility.

You are responsible for using your education not just to better your own lives, but to make the world better for others. You are responsible for being the voice for those who cannot speak for themselves. You are responsible for opening doors that have been closed to others.

When I think about the young people of your generation, I am filled with hope. You are more connected to the world than any generation before you. You have access to information and opportunities that previous generations could not have imagined. You have the power to solve problems that have plagued humanity for centuries.

But knowledge without wisdom is dangerous. Information without compassion is meaningless. Education without heart is empty.

So as you go forward from this place, I want you to remember to lead with your heart. Remember that behind every statistic is a human being. Behind every problem is someone who needs your help. Behind every challenge is an opportunity to make a difference.

I want you to remember to be brave. The world will try to convince you to play it safe, to take the easy path, to avoid risks. But greatness has never come from playing it safe. Change has never come from taking the easy path. Progress has never come from avoiding risks.

Be brave enough to fail. Be brave enough to try again. Be brave enough to dream bigger than anyone thinks you should.

And remember to lift as you climb. As you achieve success, as you reach new heights, remember to reach back and pull others up with you. Remember that your success is not just about you – it's about everyone who invested in you, everyone who believed in you, everyone who sacrificed for you.

You have a story to tell. The world is waiting to hear it. Don't let fear silence you. Don't let doubt diminish you. Don't let anyone convince you that your voice doesn't matter.

Go out there and tell your story. Change the world. Make us proud.

Congratulations, Class of 1992.`

    fullText: `Thank you so much. Thank you. Please, everybody, have a seat.

To President Frederick, the board of trustees, faculty and staff, thank you for this honor. To the Class of 2016 – congratulations on your graduation from the real HU.

Now, before I begin, let me just say that I've got to address the elephant in the room. I know that many of you came here today expecting to see someone else. And I get it. You're probably thinking, where's Chance the Rapper? Or how about DJ Khaled? "Another one!" I understand. I'm not going to take it personally, because on my way here, I passed a bunch of students who were taking selfies and posting on Instagram, and the hashtag was #NotMyCommencementSpeaker.

But let me tell you, Howard University has always held a special place in my heart. This is where I learned to think. This is where I discovered that education wasn't just about memorizing facts or mastering techniques, but about developing critical thinking and the ability to question and challenge the world around you.

Howard taught me that I could be both African American and intellectual, that I could be proud of my heritage and still embrace knowledge from all corners of the world. It taught me that being black didn't mean I had to choose between success and authenticity.

And that's what I want to talk to you about today – the importance of being confident in your identity, of being proud of your heritage, and of using that strength to change the world.

You are graduating from Howard University – an institution that has produced more African American PhDs than any other university in America. You are joining the ranks of Thurgood Marshall, Toni Morrison, Spike Lee, and Kamala Harris. You are inheriting a legacy of excellence, a tradition of breaking barriers, and a responsibility to continue that work.

But I also want you to understand that your degree from Howard is not just about what you've accomplished – it's about what you're going to do next. It's about how you're going to use your education to lift others up, to tear down barriers, and to create opportunities for those who come after you.

See, the thing is, America has never been perfect. From the beginning, we've struggled with questions of equality and justice. We've made progress, but that progress has never been linear, and it's never been inevitable. Every step forward has required someone to stand up, speak out, and demand change.

And that's where you come in. You are graduating at a time when our country is grappling with some of the same issues that your predecessors faced – issues of racial justice, economic inequality, and social progress. But you're also graduating with tools and opportunities that previous generations couldn't have imagined.

You have access to technology that can connect you to movements around the world. You have platforms that can amplify your voice to millions of people. You have the ability to organize, mobilize, and create change in ways that were unthinkable just a generation ago.

But technology and platforms and tools are not enough. Change requires courage. It requires persistence. It requires the willingness to stand up even when it's difficult, even when it's unpopular, even when it's dangerous.

Change requires you to be confident in who you are. Too often, young people – especially young people of color – are told that they need to choose between success and authenticity. They're told that to succeed in America, they need to leave their culture behind, to assimilate, to blend in.

That's a false choice. Your heritage is not a burden – it's a strength. Your culture is not something to be ashamed of – it's something to be celebrated. Your identity is not something to hide – it's something to embrace and use to make the world better.

I want you to be proud of your blackness. I want you to be proud of your heritage. I want you to be proud of Howard University and what it represents. And I want you to use that pride as a foundation for building the future you want to see.

But I also want you to remember that pride without action is meaningless. Confidence without commitment is empty. Knowledge without compassion is dangerous.

You have been given an extraordinary education. You have been equipped with skills and knowledge that can change the world. But that education comes with a responsibility – the responsibility to use what you've learned to make life better for others.

That means fighting for justice even when it's inconvenient. It means standing up for what's right even when it's unpopular. It means speaking truth to power even when it's risky.

It means working to create a world where every child has access to quality education, where every family has access to healthcare, where every person has an opportunity to succeed regardless of the color of their skin or the circumstances of their birth.

Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other time. We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the change that we seek.

So go out there and change the world. Be bold. Be fearless. Be proud. And never forget where you came from.

Congratulations, Howard University Class of 2016. I believe in you.`

    fullText: `Thank you, President Hennessy, and to the trustees and the faculty, to all of the parents and grandparents, to you, the Stanford graduating class of 2008, and thank you for the privilege of speaking to you at your commencement.

I thought long and hard about what I wanted to say to you today. I wanted to tell you something that would stay with you beyond today, something that would help guide you as you leave this beautiful campus and enter the world.

And what I've realized is this: your greatest gift is your intuition. It's your internal GPS. It's that instinct that points true north and tells you which way to go.

You see, I've learned that the key to fulfillment – not just success, but true fulfillment – is to align your life with your authentic self. To figure out what your truth is. What feeds your soul.

I know that sounds simple, but it's actually quite revolutionary. Because for most of your lives, you've been listening to other people's voices. You've been told what to study, what career to pursue, what success looks like. But now, as you graduate from one of the finest universities in the world, it's time to start listening to your own voice.

Let me tell you a story. When I was 22 years old, I was working at a television station in Baltimore. I was the weekend news anchor, and I thought I was living the dream. But every day, I felt something was wrong. I felt disconnected from what I was doing. I felt like I was pretending to be someone I wasn't.

One day, my boss called me into his office. He said, "Oprah, you're too emotional. You're too invested in the stories. You need to be more objective." And in that moment, I realized that being objective, being detached, was exactly the opposite of who I was. I was someone who felt deeply, who connected with people, who believed that emotions were a strength, not a weakness.

That realization changed everything for me. I started to understand that my greatest strength was my ability to connect with people, to empathize, to feel. And when I finally got the opportunity to do a talk show, I knew that was my truth. That was what fed my soul.

The lesson is this: what makes you different makes you powerful. What makes you unique is what the world needs from you.

Too often, we try to fit ourselves into someone else's definition of success. We try to follow someone else's path. We try to be someone we're not. But your job is not to be like everyone else. Your job is to be the best version of yourself.

And here's what I know for sure: when you're aligned with your truth, when you're living from your authentic self, success will follow. Not just financial success, but the kind of success that feeds your soul. The kind of success that makes you wake up excited about your day.

But finding your truth requires courage. It requires you to be honest with yourself about what you really want, what you really value, what really matters to you. It requires you to tune out the noise and listen to the whisper of your own heart.

I want you to remember three things as you leave here today:

First, listen to your intuition. That little voice inside you that tells you when something feels right or wrong – that's your truth talking. Don't ignore it. Don't talk yourself out of it. Trust it.

Second, don't be afraid to fail. I've had many failures in my life, and each one taught me something valuable. Failure is not the opposite of success – it's a stepping stone to success. It's how you learn, how you grow, how you become who you're meant to be.

And third, remember that the greatest fulfillment comes from service. The most successful people I know – the ones who are truly happy, truly fulfilled – are the ones who have figured out how to use their gifts to serve others.

You don't have to save the world all at once. You don't have to solve every problem. But you do have to figure out how to use what you've learned here at Stanford to make a difference in the lives of others.

Maybe that means becoming a teacher who inspires young minds. Maybe that means starting a company that creates jobs and opportunities. Maybe that means becoming a doctor who heals the sick, or a lawyer who fights for justice, or an engineer who builds solutions to the world's problems.

Whatever path you choose, make sure it's your path. Make sure it's aligned with your truth. Make sure it feeds your soul.

Because here's what I know: you have been given an extraordinary education. You have been equipped with knowledge and skills that can change the world. But more importantly, you have been given the opportunity to discover who you really are and what you're really capable of.

The world needs what you have to offer. The world needs your truth, your passion, your unique perspective. Don't hide it. Don't diminish it. Don't apologize for it. Embrace it. Share it. Use it to make the world better.

Your time at Stanford is ending, but your real education is just beginning. The world is your classroom now. Go out there and learn. Go out there and grow. Go out there and make a difference.

And remember: your greatest gift is your intuition. Trust it. Follow it. It will never lead you astray.

Congratulations, Class of 2008. I can't wait to see what you do next.`

    fullText: `Thank you very much. Thank you. President Gutmann, Dean Garrett, faculty, family, friends, and graduates.

It's an honor to be here today. I'm honored to receive this degree and to be here with you. You know, when I first heard I was going to be a commencement speaker, I thought, what am I going to say to these students that's going to help them? What wisdom can I share?

And then I realized: I don't have to have all the answers. I just have to share what I've learned. So that's what I'm going to do today. I'm going to share with you some of the lessons that life has taught me.

The first lesson is this: fall forward.

Here's what I mean by that. I found that nothing in life is worthwhile unless you take risks. Nothing. Nelson Mandela said, "There is no passion to be found playing small and settling for a life that's less than the one you're capable of living."

I'm sure in your experiences in school, in applying to college, in studying abroad, in getting jobs, in life – you've had to take risks. And some of those risks didn't pay off. Some of them resulted in failure.

But here's the thing about failure: you can't let it defeat you. You've got to learn from it. You've got to use it as a stepping stone to success.

Thomas Edison conducted 1,000 failed experiments. Did you know that? I didn't know that either, until I looked it up. But Edison said, "I didn't fail 1,000 times. I found 1,000 ways not to make a light bulb."

Every failed experiment is one step closer to success. You've got to take risks. And when you do fail – and you will fail – fall forward.

Every failure teaches you something. Every setback prepares you for something bigger. Every disappointment contains within it the seeds of greater opportunity.

I've failed a lot in my life. I've failed more than I've succeeded. But I never failed backward. I always failed forward. And eventually, those failures led to success.

The second lesson I want to share with you is this: you've got to work hard.

There's no substitute for hard work. I don't care how talented you are. I don't care how smart you are. I don't care how much natural ability you have. If you don't work hard, someone who's less talented but more dedicated will beat you every time.

I've been acting for over 30 years, and I can tell you that talent is common. What's uncommon is dedication. What's uncommon is the willingness to work harder than everyone else. What's uncommon is the willingness to do the things that others won't do.

When I was starting out as an actor, I was hungry. Literally hungry. I would audition for anything. I would take any role. I would work for free if it meant getting experience. While other actors were waiting for the perfect opportunity, I was working. While they were talking about their dreams, I was living mine.

Hard work is the price of admission to any success worth having. And here's the thing: hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard.

The third lesson is this: give back.

Success isn't just about what you accomplish in your life. It's about what you inspire others to do. It's about how you lift others up. It's about how you make the world better than you found it.

I've been blessed in my career. I've had opportunities that many people never get. I've achieved things that I never dreamed possible when I was your age. But none of that would mean anything if I didn't use it to help others.

You've been given a great education here at the University of Pennsylvania. You've been equipped with knowledge and skills that can change the world. But with that privilege comes responsibility. The responsibility to give back. The responsibility to lift others up. The responsibility to use your success to help those who haven't had the same opportunities.

And here's what I've learned about giving back: it's not just good for the people you help. It's good for you too. It gives your life meaning. It gives your success purpose. It makes everything you've accomplished worthwhile.

The fourth and final lesson I want to share with you is this: put God first.

I know this might make some of you uncomfortable. I know that not everyone here shares the same beliefs. But I have to speak my truth. And my truth is that everything I have, everything I've accomplished, everything I am, is because of God.

When I didn't know which way to go, I prayed. When I was facing challenges that seemed insurmountable, I prayed. When I achieved success, I gave thanks. God has been the foundation of my life, and he's been the source of my strength.

I'm not saying you have to believe what I believe. I'm not saying you have to pray like I pray. But I am saying that you need something bigger than yourself to anchor your life. You need something that gives your life meaning beyond your own success. You need something that keeps you humble when you're on top and gives you hope when you're down.

So as you leave this place and go out into the world, remember these four things:

Fall forward. Take risks. Embrace failure as a teacher, not an enemy.

Work hard. There's no substitute for it. Talent without work ethic is wasted potential.

Give back. Use your success to lift others up. Make the world better than you found it.

And put God first. Find something bigger than yourself to anchor your life.

You are graduating from one of the finest universities in the world. You have been equipped with the tools to succeed. But success is not guaranteed. Success requires courage. It requires persistence. It requires faith.

The world needs what you have to offer. The world needs your energy, your passion, your ideas, your solutions. Don't hold back. Don't play small. Don't settle for less than you're capable of.

Take risks. Work hard. Give back. Put God first. And always, always fall forward.

Congratulations, Class of 2011. Now go out there and make a difference.`

    fullText: `President Wilson, distinguished faculty, proud families, and most importantly, the graduating class of 2015.

I stand before you today humbled and honored to address the sons of Morehouse, an institution that has produced some of the most important leaders in American history. You sit where Martin Luther King Jr. sat. You walk where Spike Lee walked. You study where Julian Bond studied.

But I want to talk to you today not about the legends who came before you, but about the struggle that brought you here. Because make no mistake – your presence here today is not an accident. It is not simply the result of your own hard work, though that work has been considerable. It is the result of a centuries-long struggle, a dream deferred and finally realized.

Your ancestors dreamed you into existence. They dreamed of a time when young Black men could walk onto a college campus not as servants or laborers, but as scholars. They dreamed of a time when the children of enslaved people could sit in classrooms and debate ideas, conduct research, and prepare to lead.

That dream was not free. It was paid for with blood, sweat, and tears. It was paid for by people who were lynched for trying to learn to read. It was paid for by students who integrated universities at the risk of their lives. It was paid for by parents who worked multiple jobs so their children could have opportunities they never had.

You are the inheritors of that dream. But inheritance comes with responsibility.

The first responsibility is to understand. Understand that your education is not just about you. It's about all of us. It's about proving wrong every person who ever said that Black people couldn't learn, couldn't lead, couldn't excel. Every A you earn, every degree you complete, every success you achieve is a refutation of centuries of lies about who we are and what we can accomplish.

The second responsibility is to question. Your ancestors fought for your right to be here, but they didn't fight so that you could simply accept everything you're told. They fought so that you could think critically, question authority, and challenge the status quo.

Don't be satisfied with easy answers. Don't accept injustice because it's always been that way. Don't let anyone tell you that the way things are is the way things have to be.

The world will try to convince you that racism is over, that inequality is a thing of the past, that if you just work hard enough, you can overcome any obstacle. But you know better. You've seen the statistics. You've experienced the reality. You know that the playing field is not level, that the systems we navigate were not designed for our success.

That knowledge is not meant to discourage you. It's meant to prepare you. It's meant to help you understand that your success requires not just individual excellence, but collective action. It requires not just personal achievement, but systemic change.

The third responsibility is to act. Education without action is meaningless. Knowledge without application is empty. You have been equipped with tools – the ability to think, to analyze, to communicate, to lead. But tools are only valuable if you use them.

Use them to fight injustice wherever you find it. Use them to lift up those who haven't had your opportunities. Use them to change systems that perpetuate inequality. Use them to build a better world for the next generation.

But understand this: the struggle is eternal. It doesn't end when you graduate. It doesn't end when you get a good job or make money or achieve success. It continues as long as there are people who are denied opportunities because of the color of their skin, the circumstances of their birth, or the content of their character.

Some of you will become doctors and heal the sick. Some will become lawyers and fight for justice. Some will become teachers and inspire young minds. Some will become entrepreneurs and create opportunities. Some will become artists and tell our stories. Some will become leaders and guide us forward.

But all of you must become warriors in the ongoing struggle for equality and justice.

That struggle will not always be popular. There will be times when people tell you to be quiet, to be patient, to wait for a better time. There will be times when you're told that you're being too aggressive, too demanding, too political.

Don't listen to them. Don't be silent when you should speak. Don't be patient when patience enables injustice. Don't wait when action is needed now.

You are Morehouse men. You come from a tradition of courage, of leadership, of excellence. You come from a tradition of men who were not content to accept the world as it was, but who worked to make it what it should be.

That tradition continues with you. The question is not whether you will face challenges – you will. The question is not whether you will encounter setbacks – you will. The question is: How will you respond? How will you use your education, your privilege, your opportunity to advance the cause of justice?

The ancestors dreamed you into existence. They sacrificed so that you could be here. They believed in a future they would never see but that you now inhabit.

Honor their sacrifice. Continue their struggle. Fulfill their dream.

And remember: you are not here by accident. You are here by design. You are here for a purpose. Go out and fulfill that purpose.

Congratulations, Morehouse Class of 2015. The world is waiting for you.`

    fullText: `President Sterk, distinguished faculty, proud families, and graduates of the class of 2018.

It is an honor and a privilege to be here with you today. As I look out at your faces, I see hope. I see the future. I see young people who have the power to change the world.

I want to tell you about trouble. Good trouble. Necessary trouble.

When I was your age, this country was a very different place. I grew up in rural Alabama during the 1940s and 1950s, when segregation was the law of the land. I could not go to the library in my hometown. I could not attend the white school. I could not eat at the lunch counter downtown.

But I was taught by my parents, by my teachers, and by my faith that these laws were wrong. That separate was not equal. That all people, regardless of the color of their skin, deserved to be treated with dignity and respect.

So when I was a student at Fisk University, I started getting in trouble. I participated in sit-ins at lunch counters. I rode the Freedom Rides through the South. I helped organize the March on Washington. I spoke up when I was told to be quiet. I acted when I was told to wait.

Some people said I was causing trouble. They said I was disturbing the peace. They said I was being unreasonable, impatient, ungrateful.

But I knew it was good trouble. Necessary trouble. The kind of trouble that leads to progress, that leads to justice, that leads to change.

And you know what? It worked. Not overnight. Not without sacrifice. Not without setbacks. But it worked.

The lunch counters were integrated. The buses were integrated. The schools were integrated. The Voting Rights Act was passed. And in 2008, we elected our first African American president.

Change is possible. Progress is possible. But it requires people who are willing to get in good trouble.

Now, I know some of you might be thinking: "Congressman Lewis, that was a different time. The big battles have been fought. The major victories have been won. Things are different now."

And you're right. Things are different. But the work is not finished. Democracy is not a destination. It's a journey. And each generation must do its part to keep moving forward.

Today, we face new challenges. We see attacks on voting rights. We see the rise of hate and division. We see threats to our democratic institutions. We see inequality and injustice in new forms.

But we also see young people like you who are standing up, speaking out, and demanding change. We see students who are organizing for gun safety. We see young activists fighting for climate action. We see a new generation of leaders who are not willing to accept the status quo.

You give me hope. You remind me that the spirit of good trouble is alive and well.

So here's what I want to tell you as you leave this great university and go out into the world: Never, ever be afraid to make some noise and get in good trouble, necessary trouble.

If you see something that is not right, not fair, not just, you have a moral obligation to do something about it. You have a responsibility to speak up, to stand up, to act.

Don't let anyone tell you that you're too young to make a difference. Don't let anyone tell you that change is impossible. Don't let anyone convince you that the way things are is the way things have to be.

You have been given an excellent education. You have been equipped with knowledge and skills. But more importantly, you have been given the opportunity to be agents of change.

Use that opportunity. Use your voice. Use your vote. Use your talent. Use your passion.

But remember: change requires more than good intentions. It requires action. It requires persistence. It requires the willingness to get uncomfortable, to take risks, to make sacrifices.

It requires love. Love for your fellow human beings. Love for justice. Love for democracy. Love for this country and its highest ideals.

You see, the movement for civil rights was not just about changing laws. It was about changing hearts. It was about appealing to the better angels of our nature. It was about demonstrating that love is more powerful than hate, that hope is stronger than fear, that truth will ultimately prevail over lies.

We practiced nonviolence not because we were weak, but because we were strong. We practiced love not because it was easy, but because it was right. We practiced discipline not because we enjoyed suffering, but because we believed in the power of moral force to bring about change.

And it worked. Love conquered hate. Hope overcame fear. Truth defeated lies.

But that victory was not permanent. Each generation must win it anew. Each generation must choose love over hate, hope over fear, truth over lies.

Democracy is not a state. It is an act. And each generation must do its part to keep democracy alive, to keep it growing, to keep it inclusive.

You are that generation now. You are the ones who must take up the mantle of democracy. You are the ones who must get in good trouble when trouble is needed.

The future of this country, the future of democracy, the future of justice – it all depends on you. It depends on your willingness to act, to speak, to vote, to organize, to protest when protest is needed, to build bridges when bridges are needed.

It depends on your willingness to believe that change is possible, that progress is possible, that a better world is possible.

I believe in you. I believe in your generation. I believe that you will continue the work that we started, that you will fight the good fights that need to be fought, that you will get in the good trouble that needs to be gotten into.

So go out there and change the world. Make it more fair, more just, more loving, more inclusive. Make it a place where all people can live with dignity and respect.

Get in good trouble. Necessary trouble. The kind of trouble that our democracy needs, that our world needs, that future generations will thank you for.

Congratulations, Class of 2018. Now go make some good trouble.`

    fullText: `Dean Khurana, distinguished faculty, proud families, and graduates of Harvard's Class of 2018.

I am deeply honored to be here with you today. When I was invited to speak at Harvard, I thought about what I wanted to say to some of the brightest minds of your generation. And I kept coming back to a simple but powerful idea: the danger of a single story.

Let me start with a story of my own. I grew up in Nigeria, and like many children around the world, I learned to read at an early age. The books I read were British and American children's books. I read about children who ate apples and played in the snow and talked about the weather being lovely – things that were completely foreign to my experience as a child in tropical Nigeria.

But more importantly, these books shaped my understanding of what literature should be. They taught me that characters in books had to be foreign to me, that literature was supposed to be about experiences I could not personally identify with.

This changed when I discovered African writers – writers like Chinua Achebe and Camara Laye. I realized that people like me, girls with skin the color of chocolate, whose kinky hair could not form ponytails, could also exist in literature. I began to write stories.

But here's what I want you to understand: if I had not grown up in Nigeria, and if all I knew about Africa were from popular images, I too would think that Africa was a place of beautiful landscapes, beautiful animals, and incomprehensible people, fighting senseless wars, dying of poverty and AIDS, unable to speak for themselves and waiting to be saved by a kind, white foreigner.

This single story of Africa comes from Western literature and media. It shows Africa as a place of negatives, of difference, of darkness. It is a story that emphasizes how Africans are different from Europeans and Americans, rather than how we are similar.

But the single story creates stereotypes, and the problem with stereotypes is not that they are untrue, but that they are incomplete. They make one story become the only story.

Of course, Africa has its problems. But it is also a continent of extraordinary beauty, creativity, resilience, and hope. It is a continent of brilliant scholars, innovative entrepreneurs, talented artists, and visionary leaders. But these stories are rarely told in mainstream media.

The single story robs people of dignity. It makes our recognition of our equal humanity difficult. It emphasizes how we are different rather than how we are similar.

And this danger extends far beyond how Africa is portrayed. It affects how we see each other across all lines of difference – race, class, gender, sexuality, nationality, religion.

When we encounter single stories about any group of people, we risk critical misunderstanding. We risk seeing people as one thing, rather than as complex, multifaceted human beings.

I want to challenge you today to reject the single story wherever you encounter it. Seek out multiple perspectives. Listen to voices that are often silenced. Question the narratives that seem too simple, too convenient, too absolute.

As Harvard graduates, you have been given extraordinary privileges. You have access to knowledge, resources, and networks that most people in the world do not have. With that privilege comes responsibility.

You have the responsibility to complicate the narratives. To tell complete stories. To challenge single stories wherever you encounter them.

If you are a journalist, tell stories that show the full humanity of your subjects. If you are a business leader, consider whose voices are missing from your boardroom. If you are a politician, listen to the people who are usually not heard. If you are an educator, teach your students to question, to think critically, to seek out multiple perspectives.

But this is not just about professional responsibility. This is about how you live your life, how you interact with other people, how you see the world.

When you meet someone new, resist the urge to make assumptions based on their appearance, their accent, their background. Ask questions. Listen to their story. Understand that every person contains multitudes.

When you consume media, ask yourself: whose perspective is being represented? Whose voice is missing? What stories are not being told?

When you have the opportunity to speak, to write, to create, to lead, ask yourself: what story am I telling? Is it complete? Is it fair? Does it honor the full humanity of the people I'm talking about?

Because here's what I know: stories matter. Many stories matter. Stories have been used to dispossess and to malign, but stories can also be used to empower and to humanize. Stories can break the dignity of a people, but stories can also repair that broken dignity.

The American writer Alice Walker wrote, "The most common way people give up their power is by thinking they don't have any." I would add: the most common way people give up their power is by accepting single stories about themselves and others.

But when we reject the single story, when we realize that there is never a single story about any place or any person, we regain a kind of paradise. We regain our full humanity.

You have the power to shape narratives. You have the power to tell stories that matter. You have the power to challenge single stories and to create space for multiple stories to be told.

As you leave Harvard and go out into the world, I want you to remember that your story matters. But so do other people's stories. All of our stories matter.

Don't let anyone reduce you to a single story. Don't reduce others to single stories. Seek complexity. Embrace nuance. Honor the full humanity in yourself and in others.

The world needs your voices. The world needs your stories. But it also needs you to listen to other stories, to amplify other voices, to create space for narratives that have been silenced or ignored.

Change the conversation. Challenge the assumptions. Complicate the narratives. Tell the stories that need to be told.

When we do this, when we reject the single story and embrace the beautiful complexity of human experience, we create a more just, more understanding, more connected world.

That is your challenge. That is your opportunity. That is your responsibility.

Congratulations, Harvard Class of 2018. Now go out there and tell some beautiful, complicated, human stories.`

    ],
    fullText: `President Roth, distinguished faculty, proud families, and graduates of the Class of 2019.

Thank you for this incredible honor. When I was asked to speak to you today, I was both thrilled and terrified. Thrilled because Wesleyan has a reputation for producing thoughtful, engaged citizens who go on to change the world. Terrified because I knew I wanted to say something meaningful to such an accomplished group of young people.

So I want to talk to you today about two things that have guided my life and career: authenticity and excellence. And how pursuing both can lead you to a life of purpose and fulfillment.

Let me start with authenticity. For most of my early career, I was trying to be what I thought Hollywood wanted me to be. I was trying to fit into a particular image, to play particular types of roles, to be a particular kind of actor.

But it wasn't working. I wasn't getting the parts I wanted. I wasn't feeling fulfilled by the work I was doing. I was successful by some measures, but I felt like I was living someone else's life.

The turning point came when I decided to stop trying to be what others wanted me to be and started being who I actually was. I embraced my background, my identity, my values. I started choosing roles that reflected my authentic self rather than roles that I thought would make me more marketable.

And you know what happened? My career took off. Not immediately, but steadily. The roles I got were better. The work I was doing felt more meaningful. I felt more connected to my craft and to my purpose.

Authenticity, I learned, is not just about being true to yourself. It's about having the courage to be true to yourself even when it's difficult, even when it's not popular, even when it might cost you opportunities.

But authenticity alone is not enough. It must be paired with excellence.

Excellence is the result of caring more than others think is wise, risking more than others think is safe, dreaming more than others think is practical, and expecting more than others think is possible.

Excellence is not about being perfect. It's about being relentless in your pursuit of improvement. It's about pushing yourself beyond your comfort zone. It's about refusing to settle for good enough when you know you can do better.

Excellence is also about preparation. When I prepare for a role, I don't just memorize lines and show up on set. I research the character's background, his motivations, his fears, his dreams. I think about how he walks, how he talks, how he relates to other people. I prepare as if the role is the most important thing I'll ever do.

Because it is. Every role is the most important role. Every opportunity is the most important opportunity. Every moment is the most important moment.

Excellence is also about service. Using your talents not just for your own benefit, but for the benefit of others. Using your platform, however big or small, to make a positive impact on the world.

As an actor, I've been privileged to portray characters that represent communities that have been underrepresented in film and television. I've played a Muslim piano teacher in "Moonlight," a jazz musician in "Green Book," a detective in "True Detective."

Each of these roles came with responsibility. Not just to deliver a good performance, but to represent these characters and communities with dignity, complexity, and truth. To avoid stereotypes and single stories. To show the full humanity of people who are often reduced to caricatures.

This is what I mean by excellence in service. Using your skills, your talents, your opportunities to lift others up, to tell stories that matter, to create a more just and inclusive world.

Now, I know that not all of you will become actors. You'll become doctors, lawyers, teachers, entrepreneurs, public servants, artists, scientists. But whatever you do, you can pursue both authenticity and excellence.

You can be true to your values while striving to be the best at what you do. You can refuse to compromise your integrity while pushing yourself to achieve at the highest level. You can serve others while fulfilling your own dreams and ambitions.

But this requires choices. It requires saying no to opportunities that don't align with your values. It requires working harder than your competitors. It requires taking risks that might not pay off.

It requires faith. Faith in yourself, faith in your abilities, faith in your vision of what's possible.

When I was starting out, people told me that there weren't enough opportunities for actors who looked like me, who came from backgrounds like mine. They told me to lower my expectations, to be grateful for whatever I could get, to wait for someone else to create opportunities for me.

But I refused to accept those limitations. I chose to believe that excellence would create its own opportunities. I chose to believe that authenticity would resonate with audiences. I chose to believe that the world was ready for stories that hadn't been told before.

And I was right. Not because I was special or exceptionally talented, but because I was willing to do the work. Because I was willing to be patient. Because I was willing to bet on myself when others wouldn't.

You have the same opportunity. You have been educated at one of the finest institutions in the world. You have been given tools and knowledge that can change the world. You have been prepared for leadership.

But preparation is not enough. You have to act. You have to take risks. You have to be willing to fail in service of something greater than yourself.

You have to care more than others think is wise. You have to risk more than others think is safe. You have to dream more than others think is practical. You have to expect more than others think is possible.

Because that's what excellence looks like. That's what authenticity demands. That's what the world needs from you.

The world needs your unique perspective. The world needs your authentic voice. The world needs your commitment to excellence. The world needs you to be who you are at the highest level possible.

Don't shrink yourself to fit into someone else's vision of who you should be. Don't lower your standards to match other people's expectations. Don't apologize for wanting more, for dreaming big, for refusing to settle.

Be authentic. Be excellent. Be of service.

And remember: success is not just about what you achieve. It's about who you become in the process of achieving it. It's about how you treat people along the way. It's about whether you use your success to create opportunities for others.

The world is waiting for what you have to offer. Don't make us wait too long.

Congratulations, Class of 2019. Now go out there and show us what authentic excellence looks like.`

    fullText: `President Johnson, distinguished faculty, proud families, and the remarkable women of Agnes Scott College Class of 2020.

It is an extraordinary honor to be here with you today, even if we're gathering in these unusual circumstances. You are graduating during one of the most challenging times in our nation's history, but you are also graduating at a time when your leadership has never been more needed.

I want to talk to you today about democracy. Not as an abstract concept, but as a living, breathing responsibility that belongs to each of you.

Democracy is not a spectator sport. It's not something that happens to you – it's something you participate in, something you shape, something you fight for every single day.

I learned this lesson early in my life. I grew up in Mississippi and Georgia in a family that understood that our rights were not guaranteed, that our voice mattered, and that democracy only works when all of us participate.

My parents taught me that voting was sacred. They taught me that people died for the right to vote, that people marched and bled and sacrificed so that I could walk into a voting booth and have my voice heard.

But they also taught me that voting is not enough. Democracy requires more than just showing up every four years to vote for president. It requires daily engagement, constant vigilance, and the willingness to speak up when something is wrong.

It requires us to pay attention to what's happening in our communities, our states, and our nation. It requires us to hold our elected officials accountable. It requires us to organize, to advocate, and to act.

And sometimes, it requires us to run for office ourselves.

When I first ran for the Georgia House of Representatives in 2006, people told me I was too young, too idealistic, too ambitious. They said a young Black woman from Mississippi had no business thinking she could represent anyone in the Georgia legislature.

But I knew that if we wait for permission to lead, we'll be waiting forever. I knew that change doesn't happen when we sit on the sidelines hoping someone else will fight our battles for us. Change happens when ordinary people decide to do extraordinary things.

So I ran. And I won. And for ten years, I had the privilege of serving in the Georgia legislature, fighting for issues I cared about – education, economic opportunity, criminal justice reform, voting rights.

But it was after I left the legislature that I learned my most important lesson about democracy. In 2018, I ran for governor of Georgia. I came closer than any Democrat had in decades, but I came up short. I could have been bitter. I could have given up. I could have decided that the system was too rigged, too corrupt, too stacked against people like me.

Instead, I decided to double down on democracy. I founded Fair Fight, an organization dedicated to ensuring that every eligible voter has access to the ballot box. Because I realized that my loss wasn't just about me – it was about the thousands of Georgians who were prevented from voting, who were purged from voter rolls, who faced long lines and broken machines and other barriers to exercising their fundamental right.

I realized that democracy is fragile. It requires constant maintenance, constant protection, constant participation. And when some people are excluded from democracy, all of democracy suffers.

This is not a partisan issue. This is about the basic principle that in a democracy, every voice should be heard, every vote should count, and every person should have an equal say in choosing their leaders.

But here's what I've learned: democracy is not self-executing. It doesn't just happen automatically. It requires people who are willing to do the work – the unglamorous, difficult, often thankless work of organizing, registering voters, fighting for fair maps, pushing for good policies, and holding officials accountable.

It requires people like you.

You are graduating from an institution that has a long tradition of producing women who change the world. Agnes Scott alumnae have been pioneers in business, science, politics, education, and social justice. You are inheriting that legacy, but you're also responsible for extending it.

The challenges we face today – from a global pandemic to economic inequality to climate change to systemic racism – these challenges require solutions. They require leadership. They require people who are willing to step up and do the hard work of democracy.

But democracy is not just about big, national issues. It's also about what happens in your communities. It's about school board meetings and city council sessions. It's about neighborhood associations and volunteer organizations. It's about showing up, speaking up, and standing up for what you believe in.

It's about using your voice, your vote, your platform, and your privilege to make things better for everyone.

Some of you will run for office. Some of you will work for campaigns. Some of you will start nonprofits or advocacy organizations. Some of you will become journalists or teachers or social workers or doctors or lawyers or business leaders.

But all of you can be champions of democracy. All of you can be agents of change. All of you can use whatever platform you have to make our democracy more inclusive, more representative, more responsive to the needs of all people.

Here's what I want you to remember: democracy is not a destination. It's a journey. It's not something we achieve once and then forget about. It's something we have to work on every day, in every election, in every interaction, in every decision we make about how to live our lives and use our talents.

And democracy is not perfect. It never has been. But it's the best system we have for ensuring that all people have a voice in their own governance. And it's worth fighting for, worth protecting, worth strengthening.

The question is not whether you'll face challenges to democracy in your lifetime – you will. The question is how you'll respond to those challenges. Will you be bystanders, or will you be participants? Will you be observers, or will you be leaders?

I believe in you. I believe in your generation. I believe that you have the knowledge, the passion, and the determination to make our democracy stronger, more inclusive, and more just.

But belief is not enough. Action is required. Participation is required. Your voice is required.

So vote. Not just in presidential elections, but in every election. Vote in primaries. Vote in local elections. Vote in special elections. Vote like your life depends on it, because it does.

But don't stop there. Run for office. Volunteer for campaigns. Join advocacy organizations. Start movements. Create change.

And encourage others to do the same. Democracy works best when everyone participates. Make sure your friends are registered to vote. Make sure your family members know when elections are happening. Make sure your communities have access to the ballot box.

The future of our democracy depends on you. Not on politicians in Washington, not on celebrities or billionaires or anyone else. On you.

You have been educated. You have been prepared. You have been empowered. Now it's time to act.

Democracy is calling. Are you ready to answer?

Congratulations, Class of 2020. Now go out there and strengthen our democracy.`

It's an honor to be back at Carolina, the place that changed my life, the place that taught me what it means to be a champion.

I want to talk to you today about something that's been central to everything I've accomplished in my life: the mentality of champions. Because becoming a champion – whether in sports, in business, in life – is not about talent alone. It's about mindset. It's about how you approach challenges, how you deal with failure, and how you push yourself to be better than you were yesterday.

Let me start with a confession: I've failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.

I was cut from my high school basketball team. I lost hundreds of games in my career. I missed thousands of shots. I turned the ball over countless times. I failed to win championships for the first seven years of my NBA career.

But each failure taught me something. Each setback motivated me to work harder. Each defeat made me more determined to succeed.

You see, failure is not the opposite of success – it's the foundation of success. It's how you learn. It's how you grow. It's how you discover what you're really made of.

But here's the key: how you respond to failure determines everything. You can let failure defeat you, or you can let it teach you. You can let it make you bitter, or you can let it make you better.

I chose to let it make me better. Every time.

When I was cut from my high school team, I could have quit basketball. Instead, I used it as motivation to work harder than anyone else. I spent hours in the gym, perfecting my shot, improving my footwork, building my strength.

When I struggled in my first years in the NBA, when critics said I was selfish, when we kept losing in the playoffs, I could have accepted that maybe I wasn't championship material. Instead, I worked on becoming a better teammate, a better leader, a better all-around player.

Champions are made when nobody's watching. They're made in the early morning workouts, in the late-night training sessions, in the moments when you're tired and you want to quit but you push through anyway.

I remember countless mornings getting to the gym at 5 AM, working on my shot for hours before practice even started. I remember studying game film until 2 in the morning, looking for ways to get better, looking for advantages I could find.

That's what separates champions from everyone else. Champions are willing to do what others won't do. They're willing to make sacrifices that others won't make. They're willing to push themselves beyond what they think is possible.

But being a champion is not just about individual achievement. It's about lifting others up with you. Some of my greatest memories from basketball are not about the shots I made or the points I scored. They're about the championships we won together as a team.

Basketball taught me that success is sweeter when it's shared. That individual brilliance means nothing without team success. That the best leaders are those who make everyone around them better.

The same is true in life. Whatever field you go into, whatever career you pursue, remember that your success is connected to the success of others. Lift people up. Be generous with your knowledge. Help others reach their potential.

But here's what I want you to understand about the champion's mentality: it's not just about winning. It's about pursuing excellence in everything you do. It's about having standards for yourself that are higher than anyone else's standards for you.

Excellence is not a skill, it's an attitude. It's a choice you make every day to be the best version of yourself. It's the decision to never be satisfied with good enough, to always push for better.

And excellence requires sacrifice. It requires saying no to things that are easy, comfortable, popular. It requires choosing the difficult path because you know it leads to better outcomes.

I sacrificed a lot for basketball. I missed family gatherings, social events, vacations. I dealt with criticism, pressure, expectations. But I never regretted those sacrifices because they led me to achieve something I was passionate about.

You'll have to make sacrifices too. You'll have to choose between what's easy and what's right. Between what's comfortable and what's challenging. Between what's popular and what's excellent.

Choose excellence. Choose the harder path. Choose to be a champion.

But remember: being a champion is not a destination – it's a way of living. It's how you approach every challenge, every opportunity, every relationship. It's how you treat people, especially when nobody's watching. It's how you handle success and how you handle failure.

I've been blessed to achieve success in basketball and in business. But what I'm most proud of is not the championships or the money or the fame. It's the example I've tried to set for young people about what's possible when you work hard, when you never give up, when you pursue excellence with everything you have.

Each of you has the potential to be a champion in your own field, in your own way. You have the education, the skills, and the opportunities to make a significant impact on the world.

But potential means nothing without action. Dreams mean nothing without work. Talent means nothing without dedication.

So as you leave this great university and go out into the world, I want you to adopt the mentality of champions:

Embrace failure as a teacher, not an enemy. Use setbacks as stepping stones, not stopping points.

Work when nobody's watching. Put in the effort when it's not glamorous, when it's not fun, when nobody's appreciating it.

Set standards for yourself that are higher than anyone else's expectations. Don't just meet expectations – exceed them.

Lift others up as you climb. Share your success. Help others reach their potential.

Never give up. No matter how difficult things get, no matter how many times you fall, get back up and keep fighting.

And remember: champions are not born – they're made. They're made through hard work, through dedication, through the willingness to push beyond what seems possible.

You have everything you need to be champions. The only question is: are you willing to do what champions do?

The world is waiting for your excellence. Don't keep it waiting too long.

Congratulations, Class of 2017. Now go out there and show the world what champions look like.`
