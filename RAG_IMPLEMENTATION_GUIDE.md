## 🔄 How It Works

### Step-by-Step Flow:

1. **User Asks Question**
   ```
   User: "Where is the school located?"
   ```

2. **RAG Engine Searches Knowledge Base**
   ```javascript
   - Tokenizes query: ['where', 'school', 'located']
   - Scores all 21 knowledge chunks
   - Returns top 5 most relevant chunks
   ```

3. **Relevance Scoring**
   ```javascript
   Score calculation:
   - Exact title match: +20 points
   - Partial title match: +12 points
   - Category match: +8 points
   - Exact keyword match: +15 points
   - Partial keyword match: +7 points
   - Content word match: +3 points per occurrence
   - Priority boost: x1.05 to x1.50
   - Length bonus: +2 to +5 points
   ```

4. **Sources Extracted**
   ```javascript
   Sources: [
     {
       title: "School Location and Address",
       source: "Contact Page & SEO Data",
       category: "Contact & Location"
     }
   ]
   ```

5. **Gemini API Call**
   ```
   System Prompt + Context with Sources + User Question
   → Gemini generates response
   ```

6. **Response with Citations**
   ```
   AI: "St. Louis Demonstration Junior High School is located in
   Suame Mbrom, Kumasi, Ashanti Region, Ghana.
   
   Full Address: P.O. Box 3041, Mbrom-Kumasi
